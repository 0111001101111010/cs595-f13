<p><em>"We have the best government that money can buy."</em></p>
<p><em>-Mark Twain</em></p>

<p>Wasn&#8217;t this supposed to happen several months ago, but we somehow put aside our differences and made it work?  Oh right, we agreed not to think about it until later (which is now).  So NASA is out of funding, the CDC furloughed 8,754 workers (diseases have furloughed zero), and the NIH has stopped its research and halted new grants.  So it happened.  But do I dare ask, is this all bad?  (Yes, it&#8217;s bad, but stay with me here).  All day in the lab, I heard people complaining about missing online data sets and publications, government websites going down, grant reviews coming to a screeching halt, and job interviews at the NIH being up in the air.  Moreover, social media has been lighting up with people expressing how they didn&#8217;t realize how many government resources they needed just to get through their day conducting scientific research.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/44443a4089b156845e56327dde5346e5/tumblr_inline_mu0pjs4d2a1snsdec.png"/></p>

<p></p>
<p>All of this has made me wonder, will this make scientists get involved in scientific policy?  The popular opinion is that science is becoming an increasingly prominent issue throughout the world.  Yet, most of the policies are dictated by people without technical training, and practicing scientists have been reluctant participants in the national conversation.  Rees Kassen of the University of Ottawa wrote an excellent <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/if-you-want-to-win-the-game-you-must-join-in-1.9580">editorial in <em>Nature</em></a> about this very issue.  Kassen gives an example of the Canadian parliament.  Of the 308 members of parliament, 17 hold a degree in the natural sciences, engineering, or health sciences.  If these numbers reflected national university graduation rates, there would be 98 members of parliament with formal scientific training.  So the <span>burden of nurturing the social momentum of science really falls on its practitioners.  Kassen states that,</span></p>
<p><em>"researchers must recognize that poor scientific decisions in politics do not necessarily result from a lack of understanding. They are, rather, a failure of scientists to communicate their message effectively in what is ultimately a political, not a scientific arena."</em></p>
<p>Moreover, Kassen goes on to point out a few interesting points of view that I think are true.  He asserts that,</p>
<p><em>"scientists think too highly of their own view of the world and fail to appreciate the complex, multifarious nature of decision making."</em></p>
<p>And also, that to a politician,</p>
<p><em>"science is an interest group like any other."</em></p>
<p>Kassen&#8217;s observations invoke a 2004 remark from former congressman Sherwood Boehlert, who was then the chair of the House Science Committee.  As he stated, </p>
<p><em>"The argument that science funding is a long-term national investment does nothing to set scientists apart.  All that sets them apart is that scientists are the only group that thinks they&#8217;re making a unique argument."</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>What a quote, eh?  It seems to confirm Kassen&#8217;s view that science is funded as an interest group.  So if the members of that group (the scientists) don&#8217;t voice strong displeasure and opposition against funding cuts, it might make it seem that we don&#8217;t really care about the cuts, doesn&#8217;t it? Many more have expressed this same view that scientists need to get involved in policy decisions.  I chose this one because it&#8217;s a gem.  <span>If the Kassen piece didn&#8217;t grab you, how about a </span><a href="http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=1681">plea by Newt Gingrich</a><span> (of all people)!  Gingrich was a keynote speaker at the 2007 Society for Neuroscience Conference in San Diego (I was in the audience). Predictably, he was asked a lot of tough questions by the crowd, but his message was surprising.  He pleaded with the neuroscientists to get involved and help politician make informed decisions about scientific policy.  I don&#8217;t care much for the guy as a politician, but I found myself appreciating what he had to say.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The shutdown is maddening and sad.  But if anything good comes out of this, I hope that it makes a generation of young scientists realize how much government support is require on a daily basis to accomplish science.  I hope it serves as a call to action to get involved and help politicians foster the policies that allow science in the United States to thrive.  I think it&#8217;s long overdue for the scientific community to start educating the public about the values of science, and make a case for the necessity of investing in its development. </span></p><p class="answer_form_container"><iframe

<p><em>"The radiation left over from the Big Bang is the same as that in your microwave oven but very much less powerful. It would heat your pizza only to minus 271.3 degrees celsius - not much good for defrosting the pizza, let alone cooking it."</em></p>
<p><span>-Stephen Hawking</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>There have often been times in my career when I was stuck in the lab without any easy way of getting or making food.  This is the worst.  A long experiment (usually critical) makes for a long day.  But it&#8217;s even longer when you are hungry and irritable.  At these critical times, I found it&#8217;s useful to have a few non-perishable food items at work to make a quick meal with the resources available.  If anything, cooking in the lab makes for a few welcome minutes of distraction between experiments.  Here, I&#8217;ll periodically post some recipes that I&#8217;ve employed over the years.  Remember, all are laboratory-tested and scientist (at least this one) approved.</p>

<p>The recipes for nuclear gastronomy follow a few rules:</p>
<p>Rule #1: It must be tasty</p>
<p><span>Rule #2: It must be tasty</span></p>
<p>Rule #3: All ingredients must fit inside a coffee mug</p>
<p>Rule #4: Everything must be cooked in a microwave</p>
<p>Rule #5: Most of the recipe ingredients must be non-perishable (there maybe special exceptions)</p>
<p>Rule #6: All recipes must take less than 15 minutes to prepare</p>

<p></p>
<p><span><strong>Mac and Cheese</strong></span></p>
<p><span><em>Ingredients:</em></span></p>
<p>1/3 Cup pasta</p>
<p>1/2 Cup water</p>
<p>1/4 Cup milk, or 1 Tablespoon of instant dry milk</p>
<p>1/4 Cup shredded cheddar cheese</p>

<p>1) Combine the pasta and water in your mug.  Microwave on high at two minute intervals and stir the pasta between intervals.  Keep going until the water is absorbed and the pasta is soft (typically between 4 - 6 minutes)</p>
<p><em>Note: The water may boil over during the heating.  If this keeps happening, cut down the duration of the heating intervals.</em></p>

<p>2) Add the milk and the cheese and microwave until the cheese is melted (typically about a minute).  </p>
<p><em>Note: If using powder milk: you may need to add a little water to dissolve the milk, and if you&#8217;re a biologist, I highly recommend that you NOT use the lab milk for western blotting.</em></p>

<p>3) Stir and enjoy.</p>

<p>A groaner for sure, but I had to do it.  Picture of Hans Krebs, Nobel laureate and discoverer of metabolic processes such as the urea cycle and the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle).  Responsible for making me think biochemical reactions literally occurred as a series of rotating circles in cells until I was a 21-year old college student.     </p>

<p><em>Wheeler Peak, Nevada</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Of all the trees we could have hit, we had to get the one that hits back!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>-Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</p>

<p></p>
<p>This story takes a bad day at work to a whole new level.  Donald Rusk Currey was a promising graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  His Ph.D. dissertation pioneered the use of dendrochronology techniques (looking at tree ring patterns) to study dynamic changes in the Earth&#8217;s climate.  In particular, Donald was interested in knowing what tree ring patterns could tell us about the cooling of the earth seen in Medieval times known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age">Little Ice Age</a>.  </p>

<p>In 1963, Donald was a 30 year old scientist who became aware of a population of Bristlecone Pine trees on Wheeler peak. As Bristle cone pines in the White Mountains of California were discovered to be older than any species yet dated, Donald was particularly interested in taking core samples from these trees to see what they could tell us about past and current climate changes (rain amounts, temperature, etc).</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/59bd1d34a3b4e9b9dc823a87af57a824/tumblr_inline_mtyf3lNeS81snsdec.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Bristlecone Pine Tree</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>In the summer of 1964, encouraged in his scientific pursuits by a grant from the National Science Foundation, Donald made a trip out to Nevada to obtain samples from the Bristlecone pines.  He climbed Wheeler peak and took several cores from trees on the mountain.  To his delight, he found that their ages exceed 3000 years (How cool is that!).  Donald became particularly captivated by one Bristlecone tree that had such a tortuous look that he hypothesized its age must surpass the ones he had already sampled.  He designated this tree WPN-114, and dug in with his specialized hand-powered drill purchased from Sweden.  Immediately, he noticed that obtaining a core sample from WPN-114 was very difficult.  (Ping!) His first attempt caused the drill bit to break in the trunk of the tree.  When he started a second bore in the trunk with his backup drill, (Ping!) the second drill bit also broke in the tree.  Out of tools and dejected, Donald hiked back down the peak.  At this point, Donald was frantic.  He knew this was the only trip he would make to Nevada that year, and worse, all of his tools needed for data collection were now stuck inside the trunk of a tree.  His trip out west appeared to be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>In desperation, Donald located the district forest ranger office and explained his situation.  Surprisingly, the forest rangers told him not to worry.  Since Donald&#8217;s tree was not a notable landmark, they would cut the tree down for him.  On August 6, 1964, Donald and the forest rangers climbed up Wheeler peak and down went WPN-114, and Donald was able to obtain several slabs of the tree to take back with him.  He began to manually count of the rings.  After the first day, Donald was able to count 1000 rings, putting him in medieval times&#8230;</p>
<p>Day 2&#8230;2000 (Jesus times)</p>
<p>Day 3&#8230;3000 (David and Goliath times)</p>
<p>Day 4&#8230;4844 (End of the Neolithic era)!</p>
<p>At this point, Donald paused. He realized he had in his possession the remnants of a 4844 year old organism.  Until then, the oldest living thing ever recorded had been another tree dated at 4600 years.  Imagine the panic Donald Rusk must have felt at realizing that he just killed the oldest living thing known to man.  Staying true to his scientific training, Donald counted again, and again, but to no avail.  Every count showed that Donald had in his possession the remnants of the oldest living life form on the planet. Moreover, the locals and tree aficionados were inclined to naming the Bristlecone pines in the area.  And ironically, WPN-114 wasn&#8217;t a nameless landmark, it was known as the Prometheus tree, after the mythological champion of mankind who stole fire from the gods to give to humans.    </p>

<p><em>Donald R. Currey (1965) Ecology</em></p>

<p>So imagine yourself in this situation.  You&#8217;re 30, on your way to a Ph.D., and feeling good about finally creating a professional reputation for yourself.  Then you come to the realization that in your enthusiasm, you annihilated the oldest thing to inhabit this planet.  What do you do?  Despite all of the irony already embedded in this story, what makes this story truly remarkable is what Donald Currey did next.  He published his data.  I think it would be completely understandable if Donald pretended this never happened, or reported the tree as having fewer rings than in reality.  But Donald stuck to the truth.  He <span>published his findings in the journal </span><em>Ecology </em><span>in 1965, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say that he knew that his &#8216;work&#8217; would cause an uproar.  For example, the Little Ice Age is attributed to have occurred between ~1350 - 1850&#160;A.D., but in the paper, Donald attributes the era to be from 2000 years ago to the present.  Presumably, in an attempt to soften the criticism of why he was taking samples from such old trees in the first place.  Despite this, Donald went through with the hard thing.  He told the truth and accurately reported his findings even though he knew it threatened to destroy his budding career and scientific reputation.  </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>As you can imagine, there was a lot of public anger in the years following its publication.  Donald never talked publicly about the Prometheus tree.  But despite the magnitude of his error (and perhaps because of his intellectual courage), Donald continued to pursue science.  </span><span>He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 1969 and went on to have a fruitful academic career as a professor at the University of Utah, where he continued his work with Bristlecone pines in the Great Basin.  He became a well respected scientist and a champion of environmental issues. When it came time to protect the Bristlecone pines, Donald personally lobbied Congress to designate the Great Basin as a national park. Donald passed away in 2004 at the age of 70.  The University of Utah department of Geography has endowed a scholarship in his name.</span></p>

<p>“<em>And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been.  But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.  So she was turned into a pillar of salt.  So it goes.</em>”</p>
<p>-Kurt Vonnegut, <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></p>
<p>Kurt Vonnegut was referring to the Biblical story of Lot from the Book of Genesis.  Lot and Sarah were spared from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and on the orders of God, were explicitly told not to look back while fleeing God&#8217;s destruction of those cities.  Of course, curiosity got the best of Sarah, and so she looked back and was punished by transforming into a pillar of salt.  This is the story that’s stayed with me throughout my scientific career.  Not because I’m religious (I’m not), or because I read the Bible (I don’t.  Okay, my parents made me a long time ago), but because embedded in this ancient story is the paradoxical nature of what it is to be human.  On the one hand, we’re hopelessly inept creatures who can’t obey a simple command, on the other hand, we’re fiercely curious beings willing to pursue knowledge despite the consequences.  Quite simply, science is an entirely human endeavor, and arguably, it is <strong>THE</strong> most human of human activities.  It is conducted by imperfect creatures struggling with confusion, errors, emotions, and temptations.  It shouldn’t work, but miraculously, it does and it thrives.  Science works because of two beautiful cogs within our being: our willingness to fail (repeatedly), and above all else, our insatiable curiosity.     </p>

<p>So that’s pretty much all I’m going to say about the obvious: the pursuit of scientific truth is in our DNA (no pun intended).  The drive to fulfill our curiosity reflects some of the very best of what it is to be human.  But I&#8217;m really here to illustrate the parts of science that make you cringe, shake your head, and hopefully make you see that science is really a collection of genuine but flawed humans trying their best.  This blog is dedicated to telling the stories in science that reveal more about our humanity than about science (hence, “science as folk”).   </p>

<p>This seems like a good place to start.  Recently, I read a great piece by John Skylar entitled “<a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/20/why-you-dont-love-science/">Why you DON’T actually fucking love science</a>”.  In it, John makes the point that science is produced by people who endure years of sacrifice, especially in the face of federal budget cuts toward scientific research.  For example, a staple source of funding for biomedical research in academia is grants awarded to professors by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the RO1 grant.  As John put it, this is the “I made it” grant, and it is the money that pays for the supplies, equipment, laboratory space, and the salaries of people doing the research.  </p>
<p>The following is a graph provided by the NIH that shows a sharp increase starting in the last 10 years or so for the average age of a FIRST time recipient (that&#8217;s right, first time).  Mind you, these are scholars who have invested 4 years to complete a bachelor&#8217;s degree in science, ~6 years to complete their Ph.D., and ~5 years of postdoctoral training (and that&#8217;s pretty much the minimum).  Why is it going up? </p>

<p><img alt="NIH-Graph" src="http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzA5LzIwL2NhL05JSEdyYXBoLmJkZDhmLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/c5e4c5d9/454/NIH-Graph.jpg"/></p>

<p>Good question.  The answer is in the NIH budget.  The amount of money the NIH has to give out has stagnated and slowly decreased in the last 10 years.  </p>

<p><strong>Source</strong>: Adapted<em> from <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/09/20/why-you-dont-love-science/">John Skylar</a> with data from the <a href="http://www.faseb.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=aDQlNW4adp0%3D&amp;tabid=431">Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology</a></em></p>
<p>So let’s pause for a minute and think about the implications of this.  The pot of money that funds scientific careers has dwindled over the last ten years, and this has pushed the age at which scientists start their independent careers into the 40’s.  Admittedly, this sounds bad.  But scientists are a plucky bunch lacking any emotions, so they should be able to handle this disappointment without letting it affect their work, right?  Well, let’s look at some additional data.  One of the worst things that can happen to a scientist is a retraction of their work.  Scientific journals reserve the right to publicly strike a paper out of existence if the work is proven to have errors that change the conclusions of that paper at a later date (i.e., fabrication of data, incorrect analysis, etc.).  As science has grown, the number of papers that have been retracted has also increased.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/62d4e50271132c076ea2723222623d95/tumblr_inline_mtptutEJkc1snsdec.png"/></p>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: <em><a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0068397">Steen RG, Casadevall, A, Fang FC. PLOS One (2013)</a></em></p>
<p><span>Importantly, these increases don’t just reflect an overall rise in the number of retractions, but the percentage of publications that have been retracted has dramatically increased in the past few years.  So we’re seeing a real acceleration in the number of retractions in the literature.</span></p>
<p>Is the increase in difficulty of attaining and maintaining a career in science related to the recent increase in the number of retractions?  Let&#8217;s see what happens when we combine the two previous graphs.</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/5b1df11864f5c787213547c3a4251553/tumblr_inline_mtpujinaHf1snsdec.png"/></p>

<p>It sure seems suspicious, doesn&#8217;t it?  On a human level, this makes a lot of sense.  Scientific research has been contracting in the United States , and these are desperate times for a lot of folks.  Indeed, the wavering support of science by the federal government leaves a lot to be desired, and in the end will hinder scientific progress.  But before I make it sound like science is going to the crooks, it&#8217;s critical that I mention a few things to this discussion.  Science works through a collective test of time.  What I mean is that once a theory is proposed, the scientific community goes to work to test this theory through their own experimentation.  Reproducible results are confirmed and irreproducible results are discarded, thus producing a body of scientific knowledge through the action of group intelligence.  This is a critical aspect of scientific discovery.  So although <span>the rate of retractions is surely increasing, the dramatic increase in the last few years may not truly reflect a substantial increase in deceptive practices.  Indeed, due to several high profile cases of scientific fraud in the past decade, journals have increased their efforts to weed out fraudulent work.  So some of this increase in the number of retractions simply reflects better methods to detect errors, or put in a more positive light, science is evolving better methods of self-correction.  But needless to say, the very fact that the scientific community needs to divert already limited resources to detect increasing amounts of fraudulent work serves to further limit our progress.   </span></p>
<p>I also want to point out a couple more things that speaks to the honesty of the scientific community.  First, not all retractions reflect fraud or data fabrication.  In many cases, papers are retracted because of genuine errors, and often times, the papers are retracted voluntarily by the investigators once they realize their mistakes.  For an example, see <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/37/14974">here</a>.  And <span>perhaps most importantly, the number of retracted papers represents just a tiny fraction of scientific publications produced each year.  Between 1973 and 2011, 21.2 million journal articles were published according to PubMed.  Of those, 890 articles were retracted, producing a retraction rate of 1 in 23,799 articles, or about 0.004%.  Compare that to an error rate of ~2% for the U.S. Postal Service, and it looks pretty good.  This is perhaps the most impressive part of all of this.  There are a few bad apples out there for sure, but despite all of the hardships endured by researchers, and the sad state of scientific funding, science continues to hold its integrity.  In short, science is almost entirely composed of honest people working hard to produce innovative work on a daily basis.  Kind of makes you feel good about human nature and for the future of our species, doesn&#8217;t it?            </span></p>
