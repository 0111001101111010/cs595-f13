   LYRICS - "Take Me Away" By Travis Lloyd
   CHORUS
   Take me away
   unto a place
   Take me away
   where i can be free
   *take me (ya, c'mon)
   forgive me for all of the sin in my being
   take me away
   *take me away
   take me away
   breath life into me
   *yah,we gotta let it go
   can you be the light in my darkest hour
   *c'mon hiphop
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   REPEAT X2
   VERSE 1
   I ain't never been myself til I broke outa my shell
   Call me humpty Dumpty Yea I'm clumsy and fell
   But I ain't break I aint shatter I just found me a well
   And I been wishing' ever since certain people would tell me
   That I ain't nothin that I'm goin' to hell
   It gives me the ambition to get it all for myself
   But I ain't stingy I ain't greedy, I'ma share all this wealth
   I do it through these rhymes and these beats, well they help
   And I know, I'm no Adelle, but I still Sound Pretty
   To a lady in her 50's that gave my life through her breasts
   Now they're both cut off so I run through my city
   Pink flag in the air and millions running with me
   Two fingers in the air for the survivors of hell
   Reminds me of a time when I was dyin' as well
   I was dyin' to tell
   The world my confessions now I sit and I yell
   CHORUS
   Take me away
   unto a place
   Take me away
   where i can be free
   *take me (ya, c'mon)
   forgive me for all of the sin in my being
   take me away
   *take me away
   take me away
   breath life into me
   *yah,we gotta let it go
   can you be the light in my darkest hour
   *c'mon hiphop
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   REPEAT X2
   VERSE 2
   I was only age 9 when I first wished I could die
   Did you hear what I said? I'm still ready to die!
   Yea I'm down for the cause, but I ain't trying' to fight
   I will if I must though I will grind all night
   I go from city to city, and state to state
   From states to the nations 'til they seem me and wave
   But I aint trying' to be great
   I'm just trying to berate
   The people with the money writin' programs that say
   Here's a check, stay on welfare - instead of educate
   Went from that, to a bachelor's, now I'm on my way to a doctorate
   The bottom one percent?
   I say is just another excuse to give up, but no way!
   I got a grind in my heart that's only second to none
   One in a hundred is what they're calling' me huh?
   I say probably a million, I ain't givin' 'em none
   I ain't given' up nothin' from all this hustle 'n run
   I'm a hustler hustler, hustler son
   I ain't mean it like that, I was just havin' fun
   'Til my lunch money gone, and now I'm alone
   And now I'm surviving' cuz I gotta be strong
   And I gotta be right cuz they gotta be wrong
   And I'm just to grown so its time to be gone
   Its time to be gone, its time to be gone
   Time to be gone, I said its time to be gone!
   CHORUS
   Take me away
   unto a place
   Take me away
   where i can be free
   *take me (ya, c'mon)
   forgive me for all of the sin in my being
   take me away
   *take me away
   take me away
   breath life into me
   *yah,we gotta let it go
   can you be the light in my darkest hour
   *c'mon hiphop
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
   hiphop hear my confessions
   *won't ya hear my
