Most Students Are Unprepared for College, SAT Results Show

   By Justin Doubleday

   Less than half of the students who took the SAT in 2013 are ready to
   succeed in postsecondary education, according to a [17]report released
   on Thursday by the College Board, which owns the SAT.

   Only 43 percent of the test takers this year met or exceeded the
   benchmark score of 1550 out of a possible 2400, the same proportion as
   last year.

   Those who reach that number, according to the College Board, have a
   greater chance of attaining a B-minus average or higher during their
   first year of college and persisting to graduation. The mean score for
   2013 was 1498.

   In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, College Board officials
   said the number of students reaching the benchmark score had remained
   virtually unchanged over the last five years. "We are just not moving
   the needle as aggressively as it needs to be moved," said Cyndie
   Schmeiser, chief of assessments.

   For more test takers to reach a score of 1550, rigorous coursework will
   have to become more widely accessible, said David Coleman, president of
   the College Board.

   Mr. Coleman plans to better align the SAT with the Common Core State
   Standards, which he helped write. They prescribe what students should
   learn, in English and mathematics, from kindergarten through high
   school. His [18]proposal to make the essay portion of the SAT more
   analytical has been met by a mix of applause and apprehension.

   The SAT results show that more must be done in elementary and secondary
   schools to prepare students for college and careers, Mr. Coleman said
   on Tuesday: "We at the College Board consider this a call for action."

   Critics of standardized tests contend that the examinations are unfair
   to students from low-income backgrounds. Many of those students, they
   argue, don't have the same access to advanced classes and
   test-preparation materials as their more-affluent peers do.

   The College Board's report showed that test takers in the lowest income
   percentile, whose families make less than $20,000 per year, averaged a
   score of 1326, well below the mean. The average score for students from
   families who make more than $100,000 was 1619.

Raising Expectations

   Mr. Coleman repeatedly described the need to get more high-school
   students into honors and Advanced Placement courses. Nearly 80 percent
   of the students who met the benchmark score had taken AP or honors
   courses.

   "It is not enough for the College Board to observe and report," he
   said. "We are working to put students on the path toward college and
   career readiness through initiatives that expand access to rigorous
   coursework."

   He also said the PSAT, another College Board test, is a good way for
   high-school students to determine whether they are ready for advanced
   courses and eventually the SAT. "One thing that's so striking," he
   said, "is how students will often be surprised that they can do harder
   work than they thought they could."

   Although SAT scores have remained largely flat for the past few years,
   College Board officials noted that 46 percent of the 1.66 million test
   takers were from minority groups, up a percentage point from 2012. The
   percentage of African-American and Hispanic students who reached the
   benchmark score increased slightly from last year as well. It's not
   enough, said Ms. Schmeiser, but "it is positive, it is encouraging."

   Mr. Coleman said the College Board would work to make advanced courses
   readily available at schools that serve large minority communities. The
   Department of Education has also participated in that effort. In
   September its Office for Civil Rights reached an [19]agreement with an
   Alabama school district intended to give black students the same access
   to AP courses that white students have.

   Language, too, can be a barrier for some SAT takers. Students who
   reported learning "English and another language" or "another language"
   first tested as high in math as their English-first peers—or higher
   than them. But on the critical-reading and writing sections, the
   average scores for that first group of students—who made up nearly 30
   percent of those tested—were notably lower than for those who had
   learned only English first.

   Mr. Coleman said his first public event after becoming president of the
   College Board, in 2012, was a panel discussion with experts in
   English-language learning to explore how students could be exposed to
   more complex texts and could improve their critical reading and
   writing.

   "Those course skills are crucial for success in the future," he said.

   As for forthcoming changes in the SAT, including the essay portion of
   the test, Mr. Coleman said to expect details in January.
