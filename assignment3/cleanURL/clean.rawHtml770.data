   [35]instagram embed

   Instagram has finally rolled out the ability for users to [36]embed
   videos and photos. In reality, it’s been a mere three weeks since video
   for Instagram was introduced, but the missing embed link has honestly
   been [37]incredibly frustrating (and, of course, this frustration has
   long existed when it comes to still photos). Anyone who wanted to share
   their Instagram images and videos with the world without cross-posting
   like a madman was out of luck. Admittedly, this missing feature was
   probably most frustrating to the tech writers and bloggers out there
   whose WordPress- (or anything other than Tumblr) based sites [38]had to
   find workarounds.

   For videos, you had the option to push something to Facebook, make it
   public, and grab the embed code there; for stills, the same applied and
   you could find that download link and then reupload to your own site.
   Or you could use third party options out there. Regardless, a lot of
   steps were to be taken. But thankfully, Instagram has given us the
   native tools to pull and place our Instagrams wherever the hell we
   please.

   download or embed instagram

   For that, Instagram/Facebook deserve a giant thank you. Seriously,
   thank you. I was sick of spamming the bejesus out of my Facebook
   friends by pushing posts there and grabbing the respective code or
   finding download links (which really only worked with publicly posted
   Instagrams or those from people I am Facebook friends with). And
   resorting to a screenshot is really the last ditch effort out there.
   The “inspect element”-ing of this content got old fast, too.

   It should be noted that it took awhile for Instagram to bring its embed
   game – perhaps because when it supported Twitter Cards, that was the
   simple solution. Twitter has been doing embeds right for awhile now.
   The ability to embed a tweet isn’t just better (it’s clickable, takes
   you directly to the tweet in question, pulls in metadata, and expands
   to show media content if the tweet has attached anything that supports
   Twitter Cards), it can keep publishers (and that’s all you casual
   bloggers, too) [39]out of trouble. Using Twitter’s embedding tool means
   that whatever you’re reposting falls under the platform’s “reposting
   rights,” which are including in its Terms of Service.

   Taking a screenshot of a tweet and using it won’t necessarily get you
   into legal trouble, but you can avoid all potential brouhaha by simply
   hitting up embed.

   Twitter, of course, is naturally a much more public forum than the
   likes of Facebook and Instagram, so it makes a lot of sense for the
   embed option to be available. And this means things could be a little
   tricky for Instagram.

   Plenty of people want their profiles linked back to, even if it’s for
   something as inane as an Instagram image or a tweet.

   With Instagram, privacy is all or nothing: You either have an entirely
   public profile or your approved followers can see your images. That’s
   it. The fact that profiles aren’t all that easily searchable means you
   can live in (relative) Instagram anonymity if you want, even if you’re
   profile is public. If you aren’t pushing things out to Twitter or
   Facebook, then you can lie relatively low. The embed feature, however,
   means that it will only be easier and more intuitive for your content
   to wind up elsewhere.

   With Facebook, you have the option of sharing how you want (or as close
   to that as Facebook will allow you to get). But Instagram doesn’t work
   this way; so if there were a handful of photos you’d like to publicly
   share and wouldn’t give a damn if they were embedded on sites across
   the [40]Web … but there were others you’d rather keep off the
   Internets, well that’s too damn bad. Again: It’s all or nothing. Do
   know, however, that if you have a private Instagram profile and your
   photo is embedded, only people who you allow to follow, and are logged
   into the platform, you will see these images. Think of it like this –
   Instagram shows more than Facebook does via embed (which is … well,
   nothing, since Facebook doesn’t support it), and less than Twitter
   (where everything is public).

   Before Instagram embeds, I sort of had the Twitter rule for my
   Instagram images: I left my profile public (something I changed
   post-Facebook acquisition), and if I didn’t care if the images were
   replastered somewhere, I would push them to Twitter and someone could
   grab the embed code there (if for some reason my feed of photos of
   dogs, mountains, and Star Wars paraphernalia was interesting to someone
   – which they were one time when the Portland Trailblazers used one of
   my images – clearly a moment I cling to). But when Twitter Card support
   was pulled, that rule was obviously thrown out the window.

   So why did Instagram/Facebook finally introduce this? Videos probably.
   Third party options to embed the new videos were rushing out of the
   woodwork – and it didn’t help that Vine had enabled embeds. If you want
   your feature to get attention, you want people to write blog posts
   about the “10 best Instagram Videos” instead of the “10 best Vines,”
   you need easy embeds.

   The screenshot workaround was sufficient for images, but it for obvious
   reasons wasn’t going to cut it for video. And thus, it would appear
   Instagram was peer-pressured into handing out the embed.

   Personally, I think embedding makes the Internet better: It’s
   interactive, intuitive, deeper sourcing. Instead of a flat image, I can
   be transported to the original thing in question, including the
   conversations and comments happening it around it in real time that
   maybe didn’t even exist when that piece of content was originally
   reposted. It’s like a living, breathing, evolving source that doesn’t
   have to exist within the parameters of the single story that pulled it
   in. Plus, there’s the argument of authorship: Whether you think being a
   social content creator is a real thing or not, there are plenty of
   people who want their profiles linked back to, even if it’s for
   something as inane as an Instagram image or a tweet. Many people want
   to be as discoverable as possible.

   But because this new feature inevitably means there will be more
   reposted Instagram content (that can then easily be tied back to
   users), there are those of you who will rush to your Instagram accounts
   and make them private. You could argue that embeddable content is
   something we should be able to opt-in to, but we’re not even allowed to
   opt-out of it. So for the time being, if you want your Instagrams to
   remain sacred and within the platform, you need to choose the private
   profile. And then pray you aren’t friends with anyone who might want to
   republish all those drunk brunch pictures I know so many of you have.
