   5.0 out of 5 stars [114]advanced recipes for python 3 June 16, 2013
   By [115]Jeanne Boyarsky
   Format:Paperback
   The "Python Cookbook" (3rd edition) is over 600 pages full of content.
   The recipes vary extensively in difficulty and scope. From simple
   string concatenation to writing a (BNF) recursive decent parsers.
   The book covers Python 3.3. The authors warn some recipes aren't
   backward compatible with 2.X. While I would have liked more on the
   transition, I'm not a Python developer - I just do some scripts. It's
   entirely possible nobody cares about compatibility.
   My favorite recipe was on CSV. Paring was shown but a library was also
   covered along with the reasons to not implement it yourself.
   The recipes assume a working knowledge of Python. I have just enough
   knowledge to be able to follow them. And the book is a great resource
   with common idioms and techniques. It is certainly an advanced book and
   I highly recommend it. (If you are starting out with Python, I
   recommend reading "Think Python" first.)
   Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in
   exchange for writing a review.

   5.0 out of 5 stars [119]Python 3: The Power is Yours! June 14, 2013
   By [120]Alejandro Cabrera
   Format:Paperback
   This book is an amazing resource for making the most of Python 3. This
   book truly makes it apparent what you're missing out on in the land of
   Python 2 and shows what can be accomplished more concisely in Python 3.
   For example, as early as chapter 1, you're introduced to advanced
   unpacking techniques available in Python 3:
   head, *tail = elems
   The equivalent in Python 2 is:
   head, tail = elems[0], elems[1:]
   The chapter on generators and iterations techniques alone is worth the
   price of this book. It shows you how to "Loop Like a Native", all the
   way through using partial function application combined with lambdas to
   lazily loop over the contents of a file, ending when there's nothing
   left to read. Elegant!
   There's more gems here, but I'll leave them for you to discover. The
   authors did a wonderful job of putting this book together, and I highly
   recommend this to anyone interested in becoming an effective
   Pythonista!

   5.0 out of 5 stars [124]Excellent value May 31, 2013
   By [125]Brandon
   Format:Paperback|Amazon Verified Purchase
   I have not owned any previous editions of this book to compare this 3rd
   edition to, but thus far I am thoroughly impressed. It is indeed
   "packed with practical recipes", each one having a concise yet clear
   explanation of what is happening and why. I have a fair amount of
   Python experience but have already learned about several methods I
   didn't know about (or have discovered novel ways of using known
   methods). This book sold itself to me by letting me preview it here on
   Amazon. I suggest that you do the same to gauge your interest in it. As
   an added bonus, although I have not yet done any projects with Python
   3.x, I have no qualms about doing so with this book in hand. Kudos to
   the authors. Well worth the purchase.

   4.0 out of 5 stars [129]The Python Domestic Science Textbook? June 23,
   2013
   By [130]renaissance geek
   Format:Paperback
   A few years ago now I was working in a job that required me to code in
   PERL. My PERL is passable but no better than that so when I found a
   copy of the PERL cookbook it was something of a life saver and constant
   companion. The PERL cookbook is deeply pragmatic and addresses real
   world problems with the language almost as an afterthought. (Which now
   I think about is actually a pretty good description of PERL anyway!)
   The Python cookbook is a very different beast and is much more an
   exercise in learning the intricacies and nuances of the language. I'm
   not sure cookbook is the right title - if the PERL Cookbook is a
   cookbook then the Python Cookbook is more of a domestic science
   textbook. A bit deeper, a bit dryer and not so focused on immediate
   problems. This is no way meant to imply that it's a bad book, on the
   contrary it's a very good book just not entirely what I was expecting.
   The book itself is divided into fifteen large sections covering the
   likes of data structures and algorithms; functions; metaprogramming and
   concurrency with each section consisting of a number of problems. The
   problems are structured as a definition of the problem, a solution and
   a discussion of the solution and how it can be extended. Due to the
   nature of the Python language a large part of solving the problems lies
   in knowing which module(s) to include in your code so each problem is
   generally only a couple of pages, but that is certainly enough to give
   the solution and reasonably detailed discussion. As with all books of
   this type there is going to be some complaints of why is X included and
   not Y and to be honest if you tried to cover all the possible problems
   a practicing python programmer is likely to run across the book would
   end up so large as to be unusable. That being said there was, for me at
   least, one glaring omission. I do a lot of data processing with
   reasonably large data sets, and with the buzz around big data I'm sure
   I'm not the only one, and frequently find that I have to break down the
   data sets or I simply consume all the system resources and the program
   exits. I would have expected at least some treatment of working with
   very large data sets which seems to be entirely missing. However this
   is an issue based on what I use Python for and may very well not matter
   to you. Even though there may not be exactly the solution you are
   looking for, there are 260 problems and solutions in the Python
   cookbook so if you don't learn something new you are probably a
   certified Python genius and beyond manuals anyway.
   There are a couple of quick final points to make about the Python
   cookbook. Firstly it uses Python 3 and as many very useful third party
   modules haven't been ported from Python 2.X over to Python 3 yet Python
   2.X is still probably still more widely used. Secondly although this is
   a language learning book it's not aimed at the novice programmer, think
   of it more as language nuances and inflections for the experienced
   Pythonista rather than a how to learn Python book and you won't go far
   wrong. [131]Read more ›

   5.0 out of 5 stars [135]Extensive tome of recipes for the Python 3
   programmer September 1, 2013
   By [136]Devendra
   Format:Paperback
   Python Cookbook is an extensive tome of recipes for the Python 3
   programmer. It is a perfect companion book for those migrating Python 2
   code to Python 3. If you are stuck with Python 2, you may still find
   the second edition of the book for sale, but the recipes may be dated
   as they cover Python 2.4. It is not a beginners book. If you are
   looking for a beginners book, I recommend Learning Python by Mark Lutz.
   A quick chapter summary follows.
   Chapter 1 has recipes involving manipulation of built-in structures
   such as dictionaries and sequences. Usage of heapq module for
   implementing priority queues is demonstrated. Chapter 2 covers string
   and text manipulation, with extensive use of regular expressions.
   Chapter 3 has recipes for working with numbers, dates, and times. Usage
   of numpy module for matrix and linear algebra calculations is
   demonstrated.
   Chapter 4 provides recipes for implementing iterators and generators.
   Chapter 5 covers File and I/O, including recipes for reading and
   writing compressed files, memory mapping binary files, and
   communicating with serial ports. Chapter 6 moves on to more advanced
   recipes for encoding and processing, such as reading and writing CSV,
   JSON, XML, Hex digits, and Base64.
   Chapter 7 provides recipes for functions and closures. Chapter 8
   provides recipes for classes and objects, such as creating managed
   attributes, lazily computed properties, and extending classes with
   mixins. It also covers common patterns such as state, and visitor.
   Chapter 9 digs deeper into metaprogramming. Chapter 10 has recipes for
   modules and packages, such as for splitting a module into multiple
   files using packages, and loading modules from another machine using
   import hooks.
   Chapter 11 provides recipes for network and web programming. I didn't
   know you could use ip_network objects to generate IP addresses and
   check for membership. It also covers event-driven I/O but does not
   introduce any new framework. Chapter 12 has recipes for concurrency. It
   discusses implementing concurrency using generators (coroutines), but
   doesn't cover frameworks such as gevent, it does mention PEP 3156 that
   covers those.
   Chapter 13 has recipes for writing utility scripts for system
   administration. Chapter 14 has recipes for unit testing, debugging,
   exception handling, and profiling. Chapter 15 wraps it up with recipes
   for extending Python using C.
   I've added this book to my list of references to look into, before
   heading to Google. Source code listings use syntax highlighting, a nice
   touch that makes the code easier, and less boring, to read.
   I thank O'Reilly media for providing the book for review. [137]Read
