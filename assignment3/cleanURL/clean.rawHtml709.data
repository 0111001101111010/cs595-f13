Ruby Rails Development Sphere & Associated Myths
By JayDee

   On 09, Mar 2011 | |

   Ruby on Rails development is fast changing the norms of web development
   across the globe. Companies around the world are fast catching up with
   this magical web development framework for exploring and executing its
   true potentials; thereby serving their clients with really
   cost-effective, quick and dynamic Ruby on Rails Applications. Ruby
   developers and Rails developers are becoming the most sought after
   skilled professionals, for Software companies to hunt for.

   Ruby on Rails, being an Open Source tool, coupled with fast development
   life cycle, requires much less resources in terms of Programmers and
   man-hours; which results in the service provider and client being the
   ultimate beneficiaries. Silicon Valley based leading Software firm,
   Andolasoft Inc. is a formidable force to reckon with as far as Ruby on
   Rails development is concerned. With a vast pool of Programmers as well
   as Domain Leads, this fairly young Enterprise has carved out many
   Social Networking Sites, Social Media Marketing web apps. Andolasoft
   services include but not limited to RoR Development, RoR Application
   Migration, Social Media Integration, System Administration, Redesigning
   of Existing Apps, Performance Improvement Related Tasks and Rescue
   Support.

   Irrespective of all its popularity, RoR also has few myths related to
   it.

   Applications can be built hundreds of thousands times faster than other
   technologies: The fact is Rails doesn’t write the code automatically.
   It just lets the developers work easy by managing certain
   functionalities; thereby allowing them to focus on other crucial
   modules. It also manages the laborious part of lifting of user
   interactive modules. Having said that, such myths reflects a wrong
   opinion upon customers, whose expectations sometimes become too high
   for the service providers.

   Even Non-programmers can build web applications: This is by far the
   silliest perception about Rails development. Although the simplicity of
   this framework and clean syntax of ruby language assist in quick
   development, but still experience is required as far as writing code is
   concerned. Rails developers do need to write new and unique code, apart
   from using the Rails conventions on top a comprehensive web development
   framework.
