NSA document: critics of US drone program considered âthreats,â
âadversaries,â âpropagandistsâ

   A top secret internal US government website states that opponents to
   the U.S. drone program are to be considered âadversaries,â âthreatsâ
   and âpropagandists,â according to a Guardian report.

   This is hardly surprising, given that [13]pretty much everything is
   [14]considered an [15]indicator of [16]potential terrorist activity,
   including [17]undermining the governmentâs narrative.

   The website, which looks similar to Wikipedia, contains entries written
   only by individuals âwith top secret clearance and public key
   infrastructure certificates.â These certificates are cards that give
   unique access to restricted parts of NSA systems, according a
   [18]Guardian interview with Edward Snowden.

   All of the entries are âpeer reviewed,â according to Snowden, which
   means that the statements reflect official government positions.

   In listing âthreats to unmanned aerial vehicles,â the expected physical
   dangers, including âair defense threats,â âjamming of UAV sensor
   systems,â âterrestrial weatherâ and âelectronic warfare employed
   against the command and control systemâ are outlined.

   However, the article also describes âpropaganda campaigns that target
   UAV useâ as one of the threats facing the drone program.

   Among the âexamples of potential propaganda themes that could be
   employed against UAV operationsâ some shocking entries are included.

   One is an example titled âNationality of Target vs. Due Process,â which
   says:

   âAttacks against American and European persons who have become violent
   extremists are often criticized by propagandists, arguing that lethal
   action against these individuals deprives them of due process.â

   In other words, every single person who has argued that that [19]due
   process was not given to the [20]four Americans killed by U.S. drones
   can be considered a âpropagandist.â

   Of course, Attorney General Eric Holder has argued that their
   [21]secret reviews of classified evidence based on secret criteria
   actually count as due process.

   That would make all of the U.S. organizations who have [22]fought the
   targeted killing program in court on [23]the basis of constitutional
   principles nothing more than propagandists.

   The NSA entry even contends that âdrone strikeâ is a âloaded term,â
   which âconnote[s] mindless automatons with no capability for
   independent thought.â Thus, the term âmay invoke an emotional
   reaction,â which âis what propaganda intends to do,â according to the
   document.

   However, the document does state at one point that some opposition to
   the drone program may indeed come from âcitizens with legitimate social
   agendas.â

   Yet when the document outlines âadversary propaganda themes,â it
   includes almost all of the points raised by people in the U.S.
   concerned with the drone program.

   Among other âpropaganda themes,â adversaries claim that drone strikes
   actually make the risk of terrorism worse since they fuel anti-American
   sentiment and kill too many civilians, according to the document.

   Under a broader section on âthreatsâ to the drone program, the document
   lists various lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and
   the Center for Constitutional rights, reports by groups like Amnesty
   International and Human Rights watch, and even [24]United Nations
   investigations into the legal standing of drone strikes and
   [25]civilian casualties.

   With this latest information, it is hardly surprising to see that on
   Tuesday the Obama administration [26]blocked a Pakistani lawyer who
   represents drone victims from entering the U.S. to speak to Congress on
   the drone program.
