   The [21]P90x is a workout and fitness training program designed to
   improve physical fitness in 90 days. P90x is the third in a series of
   home training fitness programs designed by Tony Horton and a group of
   physical fitness experts. The workout program incorporates exercise
   techniques, including stretching, cardio, yoga, plyometrics, and
   strength training. P90x is aimed at people who have had fitness
   training before. The flexibility of the P90X program allows variation
   in the intensity of the workouts based on personal fitness goals.

   Basic configurations

   The P90X program is laid out into three different configurations to
   suit the needs of individuals according to their personal physical
   fitness objectives. The P90X classic incorporates both cardio and
   strength training, resulting in muscle toning and fat loss. The P90X
   doubles workout adds a second cardio routine, resulting in more
   calories burned. It is intended for people who want to take their
   results to the next level. The P90X lean program is for people who
   prefer more cardio workouts, and less upper body resistance training.

   Muscle confusion

   P90X emphasizes a method of cross-training and periodization called
   “[22]muscle confusion,” which is based on the idea that when the
   muscles have adjusted to one of the phases of the workout, they’re
   challenged with new dynamic workout moves, creating muscle confusion
   that may bring faster results. Muscle confusion is thought to prevent
   the body from adjusting to certain type of exercises through continual
   workout movement variation. The more the muscles get confused, the
   harder they have to work to keep up.

   Full-body workouts

   P90X uses a number of full-body workouts aimed at different aspects of
   physical fitness. Plyometrics is a workout designed to improve athletic
   performance. It involves fast and powerful moves, working the whole
   body and leg muscles. X stretch helps improve flexibility. Kempo X
   utilizes a number of punching and kicking martial arts moves, and
   Cardio X is a supplementary workout, implementing elements of other
   routines to help burn calories. Yoga X helps improve flexibility,
   balance and strength, while calming the mind.

   Duration

   The P90X program has duration of 13 weeks, training six days per week.
   It includes 12 fat-burning, muscle-building workouts, each targeting a
   different ability and body muscles. During the first three weeks, P90X
   alternates between cardio and strength training techniques. Week four
   is the recovery stage. In the
