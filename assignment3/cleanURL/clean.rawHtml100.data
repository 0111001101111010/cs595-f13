Pre-RuPy Python Sprint

   Posted by [20]Balázs Reé at Sep 25, 2013 02:30 PM | [21]Permalink
   Come for the Python, stay for the RuPy!

   On October 11, 2013, Ruby, Python, Clojure and JavaScript enthusiasts
   will meet in Budapest, HU to attend [22]RuPy - a three day conference
   dedicated to all things Ruby and Python based.

What's RuPy?

   RuPy is a conference that brings together the two programming
   communities and their related technologies. Challenge yourself by
   learning something new about Python. Broaden your skill set by
   exploring Ruby. Network with other developers and share ideas. RuPy is
   a great place to talk about what each community can learn from one
   another. See how others are solving the same problems within different
   developer communities. Attending RuPy gives us the opportunity to see
   what other developers are doing. Keynote speakers include: Stu
   Halloway, Jessica McKellar, and Fabio Pliger. Speaker topics are still
   being announced. Check out the agenda for [23]details!

   RuPy also happens to be a regional conference. The combination of
   Python and Ruby in one event maximizes your time and your money by
   giving you both sets of talks all in one event. Can't make it to Brazil
   for the annual Plone conference? Join us at RuPy in Hungary! With over
   70 presentations submitted, you're bound to find something that
   interests you.

Python Sprint

   Before RuPy starts, plan on coming early for the Python sprints.
   Starting on October 8th, we'll be sprinting on Python projects. Chris
   McDonough will be joining us to host a [24]Pyramid/Pylons sprint. Visit
   the github sprint page to see the outline of topics Chris wants to
   tackle. So far there are 15 packages that need bug triage. There's a
   lot to achieve and it's a great opportunity to learn and get involved
   in Pyramid.

   The sprint is open for any Python topic you would like to work on. Do
   you have a Python topic you'd like to sprint on? Interested in Pyramid,
   but would like to work on Django instead? Need an excuse to come visit
   beautiful Budapest in the autumn? Propose a sprint topic! Add your
   topic to the github sprint wiki and tell us what you want to do. The
   page is editable if you have a github account.

   Stay tuned to both the RuPy and Python sprint pages for more updates.
   New information is being posted everyday! Attendance is free, but
   please register [25]here because we need to know the number of
   participants.

A regional conference

   Regional conferences compliment the global conferences in a useful way.
   There are many developers in Eastern Europe who are on a tighter budget
   and cannot afford to attend on PyCon or EuroPython. A regional
   conference is a great place to meet people from your neighbourhood.
   RuPy tries to attract attendants from Hungary, Eastern Europe, and the
   Balcan, but it's also attractive for Western European participants.

   When I attended the RuPy conference in 2012 in Brno, I must admit that
   it was a great experience, meeting a lot of developers that I knew and
   making new connections and friendships. I am very glad that this year
   the conference comes to my home city Budapest and I am also happy that
   I could become an organizer as well. Since I organized the world Plone
   conference in 2009, I know for sure that the conference will be great
   (how else could it be?), and besides the official tracks we try to
   organize and suggest many extra-curricular and exciting events in the
   city as well, for your cultural and culinar enjoyment.

   The conference is organized by the community: the entire organization
   is non-profit, transparent and open, with the promise of the full
   budget disclosed at the end of the event. The Hungarian Python and Ruby
   communities give great help to the organization, we have several
   opportunities to participate and help, in case you would like to do
   more than just attending.

   Need I mention that if you are a company that wishes to sponsor the
   event, it is still not late! Jump on the wagon and become a sponsor, if
   you are a software developer house from Eastern Europe that relies on
   Python or Ruby for your operations, your place is here with us!
