Social media, mobile phones top attack targets

Hackers exploiting lack of security basics, finds IBM X-Force analysis

   »

By John P. Mello, Jr.

   September 25, 2013 — [67]CSO — Social media has become a top target of
   hackers and mobile devices are expanding that target, IBM reported on
   Tuesday in its X-Force 2013 Mid-Year Trend and Risk Report.

   Attacks on enterprises are getting increasingly sophisticated, [68]the
   report said.Â  Some attacks studied by IBM researchers were
   opportunistic -- exploiting unpatched and untested web applications
   vulnerable to basic SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

   Others were successful, the report continued, because they violated the
   basic trust between end user and sites or social media personalities
   thought to be safe and legitimate.

   "Social media has become a new playground for attackers," said Kevin
   Skapinetz, program director for product strategy for IBM Security
   Systems.

   The report noted that a growing trend this year is the takeover of
   social media profiles that have a large number of followers. The trend
   continues to play a pivotal role in the way attackers are reaching
   their targets.

   "It's one thing to get an email or spam from someone you've never heard
   of," Skapinetz said in an interview. "It's another thing to have one of
   your friends have their account compromised and send you a link that
   might interest you."

   Traditional sources of online aggravation can't resist the siren call
   of social media, either. "Even if email is used in an attack, it will
   be under guise of coming from a social media account," he said.
   "Attackers are becoming more operationally sophisticated."

   Social media attacks can affect more than the usual suspects, too.
   Social media exploits affect more than individuals; they can negatively
   impact enterprise brand reputation and cause financial losses, the
   report said.

   Mobile devices are also becoming a hacker magnet. "Although mobile
   vulnerabilities continue to grow at a rapid pace, we still see them as
   a small percentage of overall vulnerabilities reported in the year,"
   the report said.

   What may be making matters worse is the proliferation of mobile devices
   in the workplace under Bring Your Own Device Programs. "BYOD -- what a
   nightmare that can be for any organization," HBGary's Threat
   Intelligence Director, Matthew Standart, said in an interview.

   "It's difficult to protect your data even when you own all your devices
   and getting visibility into all your devices is a challenge in itself,"
   Standard said. "Allowing users to bring their own devices increases the
   complexity tenfold."

   The IBM report also noted that Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
   attacks are being used for more than just disrupting service at target
   sites. The attacks are being used as a distraction, allowing attackers
   to breach other systems in the enterprise.

   "Both attacks and attack threats are being used as decoys," Marc
   Gaffan, co-founder of Incapsula, said in an interview.

   "The attackers will bring down a website, get the IT people focused in
   a certain direction, tie up their resources on the DDoS attack while a
   more sophisticated breach is performed with no one paying attention,"
   Gaffan said.

   A decoy attack could also be used in conjunction with a phishing
   attack, he added. For example, a phishing message could be sent to a
   bank's customers asking them to use an alternative URL because the bank
   is having trouble with its common web address. A recipient may follow
   good security practices and paste the common URL for the bank in his
   browser.

   Because the bank is under a DDoS attack, however, they can't connect to
   the institution, he said. So, in desperation, they click on the URL in
   the phishing message and get infected.

   Those kinds of misdirection DDoS attacks, though, haven't become
   mainstream. "They are occurring, but they're relatively rare," said
   Daniel Peck, a research scientist at Barracuda Networks.

   The IBM report also questioned the dedication of many organizations to
   sound security basics. "Many of the breaches reported in the last year
   were a result of poorly applied security fundamentals and policies and
   could have been mitigated by putting some basic security hygiene into
   practice," the researchers wrote.

   "Attackers seem to be capitalizing on this 'lack of security basics' by
   using a model of operational sophistication that allows them to
   increase their return on exploit," they wrote.

   "The idea that even basic security hygiene is not upheld in
   organizations, leads us to believe that, for a variety of reasons,
   companies are struggling with a commitment to apply basic security
   fundamentals," the researchers wrote.

   Barry Shteiman, senior security strategist with Imperva, said in an
   interviewÂ that the lack of adherence to basics could be due to a
   fundamental misunderstanding of security by companies. "They don't
   understand the difference between a safety belt and auto insurance," he
   said. "They don't understand that it's more important to protect
   themselves than to preserve their reputation after a breach has been
   made."
