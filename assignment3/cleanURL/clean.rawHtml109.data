The JavaScript Warrior

   [warrior.png]

   Welcome to the JSWarrior Game. Unlike traditional games, you can't
   control your character through a keyboard or joystick. The only way you
   can control your character is through JavaScript. To beat JSWarrior you
   can't just mash buttons, you need to think up a strategy and program
   the strategy as a JavaScript function.

   But what's the point? Sure you will probably get a great intellectual
   thrill of having programmed some primitive AI within 30 minutes. But if
   you complete JSWarrior, and you are at JSFoo 2013, we'll give you a
   cookie!! Yes, it's a real cookie, the kind you can eat (a good one -
   the chewy kind), not document.cookie.

   [1]Start playing!

   Note: This game was built in a hackathon for [2]JSFoo 2013, a
   JavaScript conference in Bangalore, India. Since a lot of people are
   enjoying it, we decided to keep it up for anyone to play.

     * Concept and level design from Ryan Bates' [3]Ruby Warrior
     * Web application concept from [4]Bloc.io
     * The free [5]SpriteLib sprite library for the graphics
     * [6]Ameen - Game Engine and Graphics
     * [7]Anirudh - Backend and Documentation

   Several people asked us to make this open-source and easily hostable to
   use as an interview screening tool. We will be doing so shortly, along
   with instructions to run it on Google App Engine for free.
