Vivienne Westwood: Everyone buys too many clothes

   Dame Vivienne Westwood has made a plea to the public, especially "poor
   people", to buy fewer and better quality clothes as she showcased her
   latest designs at London Fashion Week.

   The eccentric designer sat among celebrities and fashion journalists in
   the front row for the show at the German Gymnasium in north London,
   instead of waiting backstage as usual.

   It meant she had pride of place for the dramatic opening, which saw
   supermodel Lily Cole performing an interpretative dance while wearing a
   flowing, Grecian-style gown.

   Speaking after the show, Dame Vivienne said: "Buy less. Choose well.
   Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody's buying far too many
   clothes.

   "I mean, I know I'm lucky, I can just take things and borrow them and
   I'm just okay, but I hate having too many clothes. And I think that
   poor people should be even more careful.

   "It doesn't mean therefore you have to just buy anything cheap. Instead
   of buying six things, buy one thing that you really like. Don't keep
   buying just for the sake of it.

   "I just think people should invest in the world. Don't invest in
   fashion, but invest in the world."

   Dame Vivienne also urged people to take more of an interest in culture,
   saying: "The first thing they can do, if they live in a town, is they
   can go to art galleries.

   "Start building different values, where you engage with the past, with
   the human race."

   The Vivienne Westwood Red Label collection for spring/summer 2014 saw
   models, their faces caked in black and white make-up, wearing the
   designer's trademark tartan, embellished with oversized corsages.

   There were also English country garden prints and t-shirts printed with
   the phrase: "Climate Revolution", the designer's political and
   environmental message making its mark on the catwalk.

   Those watching included Hollywood actress Anna Kendrick and singer
   Paloma Faith.

   Cole said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut, which she
   had devised with the help of a friend, but said collaborating with Dame
   Vivienne was "not even work" as she enjoyed it so much.

   "I'm doing it for the love of it... and to try to communicate the
   values we both believe in," said Cole. "I also did it because it scared
   me. I've never danced live before. I think it's important to challenge
   yourself in life."

   The Topshop Unique show also attracted celebrities to the front row,
   with those in attendance including Kate Moss, singer Ellie Goulding and
   model Pixie Geldof.

   Geldof said of the collection: "I like that it's for everybody and it's
   not snobby. I think it's very good, very British. I don't think it
   should be exclusive."

   Head designer Emma Farrow said she had been inspired by "the ultimate
   summer", and the idea of "every girl's perfect holiday". Geometric
   prints, mirror detail and shirt dresses all featured on the catwalk,
   with a colour palette of azure blue and emerald green.

   The five-day trade event, featuring 58 catwalk shows, continues this
   week.

   US designer Tom Ford returns with a show today, while Stella McCartney
   will display her Adidas collection on tomorrow.

   The event is expected to attract more than £100 million in orders,
   according to the British Fashion Council.
