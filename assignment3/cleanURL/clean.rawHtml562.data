   Uploaded on Jan 8, 2012

   I don't own anything, all rights go to their respective owners
   And now, the end is near;
   And so I face the final curtain.
   My friend, I'll say it clear,
   I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
   I've lived a life that's full.
   I've traveled each and ev'ry highway;
   And more, much more than this,
   I did it my way.
   Regrets, I've had a few;
   But then again, too few to mention.
   I did what I had to do
   And saw it through without exemption.
   I planned each charted course;
   Each careful step along the byway,
   But more, much more than this,
   I did it my way.
   Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
   When I bit off more than I could chew.
   But through it all, when there was doubt,
   I ate it up and spit it out.
   I faced it all and I stood tall;
   And did it my way.
   I've loved, I've laughed and cried.
   I've had my fill; my share of losing.
   And now, as tears subside,
   I find it all so amusing.
   To think I did all that;
   And may I say - not in a shy way,
   " Oh no, oh no not me,
   I did it my way".
   For what is a man, what has he got?
   If not himself, then he has naught.
   To say the things he truly feels;
   And not the words of one who kneels.
   The record shows I took the blows -
   And did it my way!
