First computer made of carbon nanotubes is unveiled

   By James Morgan Science reporter, BBC News
   Max Shulaker with Cedric, the world's first carbon nanotube computer

   The first computer built entirely with carbon nanotubes has been
   unveiled, opening the door to a new generation of digital devices.

   "Cedric" is only a basic prototype but could be developed into a
   machine which is smaller, faster and more efficient than today's
   silicon models.

   Nanotubes have long been touted as the heir to silicon's throne, but
   building a working computer has proven awkward.

   The breakthrough by Stanford University engineers [43]is published in
   Nature.

   Cedric is the most complex carbon-based electronic system yet realised.

   So is it fast? Not at all. It might have been in 1955.

Cedric's vital statistics

     * 1 bit processor
     * Speed: 1 kHz
     * 178 transistors
     * 10-200 nanotubes per transistor
     * 2 billion carbon atoms
     * Turing complete
     * Multitasking

   The computer operates on just one bit of information, and can only
   count to 32.

   "In human terms, Cedric can count on his hands and sort the alphabet.
   But he is, in the full sense of the word, a computer," says co-author
   Max Shulaker.

   "There is no limit to the tasks it can perform, given enough memory".

   In computing parlance, Cedric is "Turing complete". In principle, it
   could be used to solve any computational problem.

   It runs a basic operating system which allows it to swap back and forth
   between two tasks - for instance, counting and sorting numbers.

   And unlike previous carbon-based computers, Cedric gets the answer
   right every time.
   Imperfection-immune

   "People have been talking about a new era of carbon nanotube
   electronics, but there have been few demonstrations. Here is the
   proof," said Prof Subhasish Mitra, lead author on the study.

   The Stanford team hope their achievement will galvanise efforts to find
   a commercial successor to silicon chips, which could soon encounter
   their physical limits.
   Hand holding carbon nanotube wafer The transistors in Cedric are built
   with "imperfection-immune" design

   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are hollow cylinders composed of a single sheet
   of carbon atoms.

   They have exceptional properties which make them ideal as a
   semiconductor material for building transistors, the on-off switches at
   the heart of electronics.

   For starters, CNTs are so thin - thousands could fit side-by-side in a
   human hair - that it takes very little energy to switch them off.

   "Think of it as stepping on a garden hose. The thinner the pipe, the
   easier it is to shut off the flow," said HS Philip Wong, co-author on
   the study.

How small is a carbon computer chip?

     * 100 microns - width of human hair
     * 10 microns - water droplet
     * 8 microns - transistors in Cedric
     * 625 nanometres (nm) - wavelength of red light
     * 20-450 nm - single viruses
     * 22 nm [46]latest silicon chips
     * 9 nm - smallest carbon nanotube chip
     * 6 nm - cell membrane
     * 1 nm - single carbon nanotube

   But while single-nanotube transistors have been around for 15 years,
   no-one had ever put the jigsaw pieces together to make a useful
   computing device.

   So how did the Stanford team succeed where others failed? By overcoming
   two common bugbears which have bedevilled carbon computing.

   First, CNTs do not grow in neat, parallel lines. "When you try and line
   them up on a wafer, you get a bowl of noodles," says Mitra.

   The Stanford team built chips with CNTs which are 99.5% aligned - and
   designed a clever algorithm to bypass the remaining 0.5% which are
   askew.

   They also eliminated a second type of imperfection - "metallic" CNTs -
   a small fraction of which always conduct electricity, instead of acting
   like semiconductors that can be switched off.

   To expunge these rogue elements, the team switched off all the "good"
   CNTs, then pumped the remaining "bad" ones full of electricity - until
   they vaporised. The result is a functioning circuit.

   The Stanford team call their two-pronged technique "imperfection-immune
   design". Its greatest trick? You don't even have to know where the
   imperfections lie - you just "zap" the whole thing.
   Carbon nanotube wafer next to computer using this technology Cedric can
   only count to 32, but in principle it could count to 32 billion

   "These are initial necessary steps in taking carbon nanotubes from the
   chemistry lab to a real environment," said Supratik Guha, director of
   physical sciences for IBM's Thomas J Watson Research Center.

   But hang on - what if, say, Intel, or another chip company, called up
   and said "I want a billion of these". Could Cedric be scaled up and
   factory-produced?

   In principle, yes: "There is no roadblock", says Franz Kreupl, of the
   Technical University of Munich in Germany.

   "If research efforts are focused towards a scaled-up (64-bit) and
   scaled-down (20-nanometre transistor) version of this computer, we
   might soon be able to type on one."

   Shrinking the transistors is the next challenge for the Stanford team.
   At a width of eight microns (8,000 nanometres) they are much fatter
   than [47]today's most advanced silicon chips.

   But while it may take a few years to achieve this gold standard, it is
   now only a matter of time - there is no technological barrier, says
   Shulaker.

   "In terms of size, IBM has already demonstrated a nine-nanometre CNT
   transistor.

   "And as for manufacturing, our design is compatible with current
   industry processes. We used the same tools as Intel, Samsung or
   whoever.

   "So the billions of dollars invested into silicon has not been wasted,
   and can be applied for CNTs."

   For 40 years we have been predicting the end of silicon. Perhaps that
   end is now in sight.
