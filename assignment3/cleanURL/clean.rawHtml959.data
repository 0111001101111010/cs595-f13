            You are down to the wire with your kid's science fair project
            — It needs to get done and it needs to get done quick. That's
            we've provided a few great science experiments you can do at
            home, in one night, with things you most likely already have
            on hand.
            When trying to think of a science fair experiment to perform
            at home, keep in mind some simple rules. Some of the most
            impressive experiments are the simplest, and demonstrate
            fundamental scientific concepts.
            These are also great rainy-day activities with your kids, even
            if there isn't a science fair in sight.
            QUESTION: Does the color of food affect whether or not we like
            the taste of the food?
            Procedure: You can use any white food for this experiment, but
            we recommend plain yogurt. Divide the yogurt into four
            batches. Use food coloring to dye one batch red, one yellow,
            and one blue. The fourth batch is unchanged and acts as the
            control.
            Put the same amount of each yogurt into unmarked plastic cups.
            Invite 10 friends over to your house. Give each friend one of
            each yogurt sample and ask them to identify the flavor and
            whether or not they like it.
            The experiment will identify the link between color and taste
            (For example, does yellow-colored yogurt taste like lemon or
            banana flavor?), and if it affects appetite even if taste and
            smell are the same.

            QUESTION: What is the best way to keep an ice cube from
            melting?
            Procedure: Gather a bunch of different materials including
            waxed paper, aluminum foil, newspaper, and Styrofoam. Line a
            cardboard box with each of these materials, or other household
            items that might act as an insulator.
            Place a cube of ice in each box  and record how long it takes
            to melt compared to when it is left out in the open air. The
            experiment will determine what makes the best ice box.

            QUESTION: What's the fastest way to cool a can of soda?
            Procedure: Grab four cans of soda at room temperature. Open
            the sodas and record the temperature, then reseal the top with
            plastic wrap and a rubber band.
            Place one soda can in a bucket of ice, one in a bucket of
            water with ice, one in the freezer, and one in the freezer
            with a wet paper towel around it.
            Check the temperature of the cans in five-minute intervals for
            20 minutes.

            QUESTION: Which type or brand of soap produces the most suds?
            Procedure: Fill a container, such as a two-liter soda bottle,
            with two cups of water. Measure out one tablespoon of
            different types of soap, including laundry detergent, dish
            detergent, and hand soap, and dump into the bottle. Repeat
            this step with different brands of soap, such as Joy,
            Palmolive, and Dawn for different dish soaps.
            Put the cap on the bottle and shake it for 30 seconds. Quickly
            measure the height of the suds and how long they take to
            dissipate to figure out which is bubblier.
