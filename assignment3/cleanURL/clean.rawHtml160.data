   [3]Phil Haack help to add this convention by writing [4]C# convention
   guide. Thanks Phil. Aug 12, 2013added coding convention for Ruby.
   If there are something wrong in ruby convention or you want to see
   another coding convention Please leave issues on [5]Github Issues.
   Because I'm not the rubist. July 21, 2013added "single quote vs double
   quotes" convention for JavaScript. July 17, 2013I made this site for
   proof of my concept at [6]The GitHub Data Challenge II.
   Amazing thing happened. This project placed in second on [7]Data
   Challenge II Results and a lot of people like my idea.
   So, I decided to serve as a service and aggregate more convention data
   continuously.
   I reseted convention data at all and aggregate newly since old data
   structure isn't efficient and has some bugs.
   And convention data can be reset sometimes when I found some bugs.
   Please leave issues on [8]Github if you have some problems or opinion.
   Thank you for your interest.
