CSS – The basics – Box Model

   August 22, 2013 · by [8]Desi Reuben-Sealey · in [9]CSS, [10]HTML

   When I’ve helped people in the past to get to grips with HTML & CSS,
   I’ve often referred to the Box Model.  This is probably the easiest way
   to understand how HTML and CSS work together.

   To quote directly from [11]W3C “Each box has a content area (e.g.,
   text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding padding, border, and
   margin areas; the size of each area is specified by properties defined
   below. The following diagram shows how these areas relate and the
   terminology used to refer to pieces of margin, border, and padding.”
   [12]The CSS Box Model Firebug displays

   This being said, every element in web design is a rectangular box, yes
   everything.

The maths

   The outer dashed line of the box illustrated above represents the
   margin, which is transparent and does not affect the actual size of the
   box, however it can affect the position of elements around it.

   And this is how you would calculate the box dimensions based on the CSS
   Box Model:
   Width   = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left +
           border-right
   Height  = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top +
           border-bottom

   Every element has an inherited height and width. Depending on the
   purpose of the element the default height and width may be all you
   need. However, if an element is key to the layout and design of a page
   it may require a specified height and width. In this case it’s best
   that you override the default values for block level element in
   question.

Practical consideration

   [13]Different Web Browsers Most browsers released in the last few years
   have no problem with boxes and render boxes correctly.  However, it’s
   worth noting that the box model for a long time has never been pixel
   perfect for ALL browsers and this is one of my pet hates, (“it is what
   it is [14]for now” I tell myself).

   For example, let’s say you don’t declare a width on an element, and the
   box has static or relative positioning, the width will remain 100% in
   width and the padding and border will push inwards instead of outward.

   But if you explicitly set the width of the box to be 100%, the padding
   will push the box outward. You’ll come across a difference more so,
   with text area elements.  To overcome this, many developer simply set
   specific widths on these elements in order to obtain cross-browser
   pixel perfect visuals.

   Many also use CSS-Reset rules within their CSS files in order to
   further add to the visual pixel perfection.

Is this as good as it gets?

   Actually no, there are so many frameworks and resources out there that
   are making it easier for developers to create beautiful websites that
   look the same in most browsers.

   And frameworks provide a way to rapidly build a website based on a set
   of predetermined standards. Depending on the project, frameworks can
   provide a great starting point or even a complete solution.

   However, sometimes, they can also cause more trouble than they’re
   worth. So research the framework you want to use, look at the pros and
   cons then decide whether it is worth using it as a base for your web
   application.

   It will get better in the future and like many developers, we wait for
   the moment when we can cry “Browser Unification!”.

   But until then, happy coding.
