Advanced Ruby Workshop

   What is your workshop about?
   This workshop aims to cover all the important aspects of the Ruby
   programming language, in order to know this technology in full depth:
   Object Model, Eigenclass, Inheritance, Modules, Code Blocks,
   Metaprogramming, Constants, Threads, Safety, Patterns, Exceptions,
   Extensions, etc. Assuming participants have a basic knowledge of this
   language and its characteristics, we will continue investigating until
   we know absolutely everything.

   Why is this course relevant nowadays?
   Ruby is a revolutionary language that is growing year after year,
   largely thanks to the Rails web framework, that has given and continues
   to give it a great popularity. Both Rails and Ruby are increasingly
   used by all kinds of companies and organizations, and experts in these
   technologies are becoming more sought after and better valued.

   What will I learn in this workshop?
   You will learn all about Ruby and you will understand all those things
   you've seen before about this language, but still do not know what they
   mean. Besides, you will learn to use it optimally and you'll get to
   know all the available tools.

   What practical skill sets can I expect to have upon completion of the
   workshop?
   This workshop will give you the ability to improve the Ruby code you
   write from now on. You will get to know the language much better, and
   you will understand why it is best to do some things it in a certain
   way. You will start reading Ruby code that you probably don’t
   understand right now, and you will learn the most common patterns.

   Takeaways
   Discover Ruby in depth!

   Schedule
   This workshop is splitted in 2 days:

   Saturday, September 28th from 10am to 2pm
   Saturday, October 5th from 10am to 2pm

   Price
   90€

   Prereqs&Preparation
     * Bring your laptop (or someone else’s) with Ruby installed, in order
       to follow the examples that will be shown and in order to be able
       to do the exercises. If you can’t bring any laptop, we will do
       workgroups.
     * Attendees should already have previous Ruby’s knowledge &
       experience. You should have worked with Ruby, both at work and on
       your own, because all language bases will be taken for granted and
       from there, we will go forward to cover all the most advanced
       aspects of the language.

   PS: The first 10 attendants will have a T-SHIRT for free!
