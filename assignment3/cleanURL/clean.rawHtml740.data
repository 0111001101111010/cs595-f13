   The general assumption is that young kids lack the faculties to
   comprehend a topic as seemingly esoteric as programming. But it is
   code, not Mandarin, that will be the true lingua franca of the future.

Forget Foreign Languages and Music. Teach Our Kids to Code

   J. Paul Gibson began to teach programming classes for teens out of
   frustration. A computer scientist at the National University of
   Ireland, he had by 1998 become shocked at the ineptness of his
   students. “I was seeing 18- and 19-year-olds having trouble with basic
   programming concepts that I myself had learned when I was 12,” recalls
   Gibson, who taught himself to code on a Sinclair ZX81. “I realized they
   hadn’t seen any programming in school at all up to that point. So I
   thought maybe one of the problems we were having is that they were
   coming to it too late.” As word of Gibson’s classes spread, primary
   schools in the Dublin area sought his services too.

   By the early 2000s, Gibson was using game-design puzzles to teach
   rudimentary Java to 8- and 9-year-olds. His success with that age group
   made him wonder: How young is too young to begin coding?

   Gibson had read educational psychology that suggested it was futile to
   try to reach children who had yet to achieve literacy. But when he made
   experimental forays into classrooms of 5- and 6-year-olds, the kids
   grasped his lessons with surprising ease.

   With the help of a custom Java applet, he was able to get
   kindergartners to write a tic-tac-toe program, based on step-by-step
   rules the students formulated as a group. And using colored balls and
   string, he taught the kids how to create graph algorithms, an essential
   component of computer science. “We believe our work shows that you can
   start teaching computer science before students even know how to read
   and write,” Gibson (who now teaches in France) wrote in a 2012 paper.

   “Children aged from 5-11 have so much potential for learning about
   algorithms and computation that it would be a shame to wait until they
   are teenagers before we teach them the foundations.” That notion is
   still too radical for most educators. While a popular movement is afoot
   to teach children, including adolescents, to code—touted by the likes
   of Bill Gates and basketball star Chris Bosh—few people believe that
   kindergartners can learn how to bend machines to their will.

   The general assumption is that young kids lack the faculties to
   comprehend a topic as seemingly esoteric as programming.

   the concept of algorithms to children.

   But that pessimism is at odds not only with the experiences of Gibson
   and other pioneering teachers but also with the science of language
   acquisition. Extensive research has shown that because young brains are
   so adept at picking up languages, it’s best to introduce children to
   foreign tongues as early as possible. This is why so many ambitious
   parents are now clamoring for kindergartens that offer intensive
   Mandarin—they want to give their kids the best possible shot at
   learning a key language of the Asian century.

   What those parents likely don’t realize is that the same neural
   mechanisms that make kids sponges for Mandarin likely also make them
   highly receptive to computer languages. Kindergartners cannot become
   C++ ninjas, but they can certainly start to develop the skills that
   will eventually cement lifelong fluency in code.

   And encouraging that fluency should be a priority for American schools,
   because it is code, not Mandarin, that will be the true lingua franca
   of the future.

   Perhaps you remember the turtle. In the early to mid 1980s, the Logo
   programming language, with its iconic turtle-shaped cursor, was the fad
   in American elementary schools. By using Logo’s simple commands to
   create intricate graphics, kids were supposed to develop mastery over
   the Apple IIe’s that had begun to appear in their living rooms.

   But Logo seldom delivered on its lofty promise. The main problem was
   not the language itself but the lackluster way in which it was taught:
   Many instructors simply plopped students in front of computers for an
   hour a week and hoped for the best.

   The resulting disillusionment coincided with the emergence of media
   that transformed school computers from exploratory tools into library
   aids. “CD-ROMs came out, then the World Wide Web appeared, so you
   didn’t need to know commands to interact with the computer,” says
   Yasmin Kafai, an education professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

   Programming vanished from elementary schools for decades, even as
   computer science became an ever more popular pursuit at the collegiate
   level. A cultural consensus seemed to spring up: Kids should be taught
   a nebulous set of “computer skills,” but programming—well, that was for
   grown-ups.

   In the past five years, however, a number of groundbreaking projects
   have begun to prove that consensus wrong. Besides Gibson’s tic-tac-toe
   and graph theory lessons, there is Scalable Game Design, a curriculum
   developed at the University of Colorado that challenges kids to code
   their own versions of Frogger. At P.S. 185 in Harlem, children as young
   as 4 are using a language called Cherp to make robots perform household
   chores. And it’s happening overseas too: In Estonia an initiative
   called ProgeTiiger is striving to teach coding basics to all first
   graders.

   What all these initiatives have in common is an emphasis not on
   memorizing how to use specific tools but on developing familiarity with
   the general concepts that underpin all programming—sequencing,
   conditionals, debugging.

   When helping students code their first Frogger, for example, Scalable
   Game Design instructors urge them to think first about the game’s
   various agents—that is, the frog and the lethal vehicles — and then
   about all the possible interactions those agents can have. The kids
   slowly learn how to craft rules and conditionals that add up to a
   logical, functional whole.

   Videogames created by grade-school kids through the Scalable Game
   Design curriculum. Some thoughts from the coders: (1) “The goal is to
   try to get to the helicopter.” (2) “Dodge the rocks and get to the
   coins.” (3) “We are a zombie and we try to reach a diamond. To move you
   use the arrow keys. You have to not hit the ghost or else you lose.”

   The fact that young children can manage such elaborate tasks should be
   no great surprise, given what we know about their knack for acquiring
   languages. Five-year-olds trump their elders at learning Spanish or
   Mandarin because young brains are better (so the theory goes) at
   formulating “procedural” memories—that is, memories that become so
   deeply embedded in a person’s psyche that recalling them is a natural
   reflex rather than a conscious task.

   The evidence is beginning to suggest that as brains age, their capacity
   for procedural memory diminishes in favor of “declarative” memory,
   which we use to amass facts. The drawback to declarative memory is that
   it requires mental exertion to tap into—a huge minus when you’re trying
   to conjugate a tricky foreign verb on the fly. It is far preferable to
   have those conjugations be second nature to you, as a result of having
   learned them when your procedural memory was at its sharpest.

   No one seems to have researched precisely how programming languages are
   learned, but there is every reason to believe that they’re best
   absorbed by students primed to form procedural memories.

   “I would speculate that the same general-purpose memory systems that
   underlie language learning in children and adults likely underlie the
   learning of computer languages,” says Michael Ullman, director of the
   Brain and Language Lab at Georgetown University Medical Center. A key
   data point in favor of this view is the evidence regarding music: great
   violinists don’t start learning the instrument when they’re 20 years
   old but rather when they’re 3 or 4, a time when procedural memory is
   most sensitive.

   And what is music if not a form of code—a series of abstract signals
   that must be sequenced properly in order to please the human ear?

   In a perfect world, kindergartners would receive instruction in both
   programming and foreign language as part of their day. But if a school
   has to choose, a strong case can be made for code. The most obvious
   argument, of course, is economic: Demand for software developers
   already far outstrips supply, and it’s expected to increase 30 percent
   by 2020 — more than double the average for all other jobs. (It’s
   difficult to imagine any scenario in which those opportunities will be
   outnumbered by jobs requiring fluent Mandarin.)

   Yet teaching programming is not just about creating an army of code
   monkeys for Facebook and Google.

   Just as early bilingualism is thought to bring about cognitive benefits
   later in life, early exposure to coding shows signs of improving what
   educators call “computational thinking”—the ability to solve problems
   with abstract thinking. And even for students who never warm to
   programming, whose innate passions lead them toward English degrees
   rather than software engineering, understanding code still has great
   value.

   As the media theorist [127]Douglas Rushkoff has observed, to ignore
   programming is akin to relying on others to drive us around instead of
   learning to drive ourselves. The majority of our interactions in 50
   years won’t be with monolingual humans from Asia; they’ll be with
   machines. So let’s teach our kids to tell them what to do, rather than
   the other way around.
