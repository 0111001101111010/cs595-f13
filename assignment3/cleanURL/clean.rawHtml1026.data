               Relisted due to a 0 feedback non paying buyer!
   Up for sale is a lightly used MBA 2012 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD.
   I've decided to put this up for sale because I'd like to upgrade to a
      retina. The laptop is out of warranty and there is no Applecare
                                protection.
   The body is in very good condition with the exception of a few smudges
    that I can't get off the bottom of the case, these are shown in the
            pics. IF you have any questions, please message me.
     Read the description before bidding, NO international shipping and
     auction winner must pay within 24 hours or I will relist the item.
