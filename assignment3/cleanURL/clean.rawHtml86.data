     Code Climate is brilliant.
     Phil Jeffs Area 17

     I've only been using Code Climate for about 10 minutes and it's
     already become one of the most useful tools we have access to.
     Ryan Kee Flavor

     Huge fan of Code Climate. There's absolutely no better tool for
     raising developer awareness.
     Justin Reagor

     I've tried using MetricFu and others in the past, but keeping it
     running and getting actionable information proved to be more
     distraction than benefit. Code Climate has solved all of those
     problems for us.
     Garrett Dimon Sifter

     For a little while we had a code quality issue. Since making it
     visual that problem has disappeared. I don't think I could live
     without it.
     Tim Cooper

     Code Climate has dramatically improved the overall quality of my
     code. It's like getting an automated code review every time I push.
