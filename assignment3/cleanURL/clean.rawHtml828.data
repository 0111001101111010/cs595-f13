   Only 43 percent of test-takers in 2013 met the SAT's definition of
   being prepared for college, a statistic that has remained stagnant
   since 2009.

   The 1.6 million test-takers averaged 496 in reading, 514 on math and
   488 on writing, according to a Thursday report released by the College
   Board, the company behind the notorious college entrance exams.

   The College Board defines the college-ready benchmark as 1550 out of
   2400, a score the organization says indicates a 65 percent likelihood
   of a student earning a first-year college GPA of a B-minus or above.

   What, exactly, these numbers mean is up for debate. The college
   readiness statistics are just one more piece of the puzzle in assessing
   the state of America's schools, and the release comes amid a national
   hand wringing about [279]just how bad public education really is and
   what direction it should take. Most states are beginning to teach to a
   new set of national standards known as the [280]Common Core, but many
   parents and politicians are either unaware or skeptical.

   For its part, the College Board is interpreting high schoolers'
   performance on its test as a call for improvement. To be truly prepared
   for college, the company maintained in a call with reporters, students
   need access to higher-level courses -- such as the Advanced Placement
   program, another College Board offering.

   "While some might see stagnant scores as no news, we at the College
   Board see this as a call to action," College Board President David
   Coleman said during the call.

   Schools need to "dramatically increase the number of students in K-12
   who are prepared for college and careers," Coleman said in a press
   release about the results.

   Coleman previously worked as a writer of the Common Core, which seeks
   to encourage teachers to teach fewer topics but with more depth and to
   spend more time on things like informational texts. "The daily work
   that kids are doing in this country needs to shift," he said.

   Opponents of a focus on testing in schools were quick to pounce on the
   stagnant SAT results. “Proponents of 'No Child Left Behind,' 'Race to
   the Top,' and similar state-level programs promised the testing focus
   would boost college readiness while narrowing score gaps between
   groups," Bob Schaeffer, public education director of the National
   Center for Fair & Open Testing, said in a statement. "The data show a
   total failure according to their own measures. Doubling down on
   unsuccessful policies with more high-stakes K-12 testing, as Common
   Core exam proponents propose, is an exercise in futility, not
   meaningful school improvement."

   Minority students showed some score increases in 2013. This year, 15.6
   percent of African-American students taking the test met the benchmark,
   the College Board reported, compared to 14.8 percent last year. In
   2013, 23.5 percent of Latino students met the benchmark, up from 22.8
   percent in 2012.

   Representatives of the education establishment were optimistic. "While
   certainly the flat scores are nothing to celebrate, when you dig down
   deeper into the data, we see a lot of encouraging news," said Jim Hull,
   a senior policy analyst for the National School Boards Association.
   "Our public schools are doing a much better job preparing our poor and
   minority students for college."

   Secretary of Education Arne Duncan noted in a statement that the
   College Board report "affirms the decisions that states have made to
   raise their standards" -- a nod to the widely adopted Common Core state
   standards. He also lauded the gains of Latino and African-American
   students.

   "What is encouraging is that more minority students are taking the
   SAT--and their scores are improving. We must sustain and build on
   recent gains in African American and Latino college-going and
   completion," said Duncan in a statement.

   In its report, the College Board noted that 78 percent of those who
   meet the SAT college-ready benchmark enroll in four-year colleges,
   compared to 46 percent of those who don't.

   Others were skeptical of the College Board. "No doubt that far too many
   students are not college-ready, and the College Board’s appeals to have
   more students take a more rigorous curriculum is important," said Mark
   Schneider, a vice president of the American Institutes of Research who
   previously oversaw the U.S. Education Department's statistics
   arm."However, this does not mean that the CB’s suite of products
   (PSAT/SAT/AP) is causally connected to college success. This report
   skirts way too close to that causal link than it should." (AIR offers
   some [281]testing of its own, but it is not seen as an SAT competitor).

   Last year, the College Board reported record-high participation numbers
   for the SAT, leading some to attribute flatline performance to
   increased diversity. But this year, there was a slight decline -- of
   4,432 -- in how many students took the test. "There are those who tend
   to wave away the results because they say more diverse students are
   taking them," Coleman said.

   "That kind of excuse … can dull the clear call to the country," he
   added, to turn increasing diversity among students into strength.

   Since 1972, the first year from which the College Board lists
   comparable SAT results, scores have declined. In 1972, students
   averaged a 530 in reading and a 509 in math; in 1995, they scored an
   average 504 in reading and a 506 in math; in 2003, they scored 507 in
   reading and 519 in math, compared to 496 on reading and 514 on math
   this year. In 2006, the first year the writing portion of the test was
   offered, students averaged 497, compared to 488 this year.

   This article has been updated to reflect a statement from Education
   Secretary Arne Duncan.

   I wonder if that 43% that are unprepared will be the ones 6 years down
   the line crying foul and gnashing the teeth over their student loans. I
   read this as 43% of SAT takers should consider alternative routes to a
   career other than a 4 year degree.

   Ms. Resmovits, do you ever actually question or research any of the
   press releases that land in front of you.
   David Coleman, architect of the Common Core, declares, "I know, based
   on neither education experience nor actual research but only on my own
   personal insights, exactly what all American students need to learn and
   how they need to learn it."
   David Coleman, head honcho of the SAT corporation, declares, "Boy, that
   guy who wrote the Common Core really knows what he's talking about."
   And you just pass it all on to us.

   Parents are ultimately responsible for fostering an environment that
   requires the child to assume personal responsibility for their academic
   performance. Many children begin their lives enrolled in every
   afterschool activity imaginable while parents lament the interference
   of homework on evenings and weekends then wonder why their child's
   academic performance is weak. Never mind little jimmy or Janie has a
   day planner that is overscheduled, that family dinner often consists of
   food on the go because of said activities, video games, tv and lest we
   forget the fight to go to bed by at least 9pm.
   Homework should be first and not simply to get it done but that a
   enough time is provided for discussion to gage your child's
   understanding of what they have done. This may take an hour maybe two
   hours - it takes what it takes. Activities only when they complete
   their responsibilities - homework, chores. Have your children help
   prepare the family meal instead of distracting them with video games or
   TV. Education begins in the home and what begins there carries through
   to school.

   Back in the early 90's I went back to school to become an RN. I was 40.
   Even at 40 freaking years old I ran circles around the 'youngsters'
   when it came to math, English, chemistry....and I had been out of high
   school for over 20 years. The 'dumb' are now teaching the 'dumb'. Has
   nothing to do with R or D.....it's just perpetual laziness. Everyone
   expects something for nothing and they whine and play the 'victim' when
   they don't get their expected 'reward' for showing up.

   I never took my SAT's due to the fact I knew I was going to an all
   photography college who could of cared less for SAT scores. Fast
   forward 6 years, I have done graduated from that school and just
   started college again this semester for early childhood education. I
   have straight A's which I never thought was possible because I was
   always a bad student and never even took my SAT's. So wait.... does
   that mean if colleges even care for SAT scores? I got into a great
   college just fine without them. A bunch of hoopla!

   then why are the prep course for these tests not on the cirriculum?

   testing involved? Or is it up to the educator/parent to advance them?

   There are many things wrong with the education system. For starters,
   you may not want to have people who have never taught make the
   decisions. Even those that have taught usually only did it for a few
   years, at a college, or so long ago they have swallowed the kool-aid of
   administrative thought.

   Dumb the SAT down; problem solved. This way we can give Lady Bracknell
   her due: "I do not approve of anything that tampers with natural
   ignorance. Ignorance is like a very delicate exotic fruit. Touch it and
   the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is radically
   unsound. Fortunately, in [America] at any rate, education produces no
   effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious danger to the
   [politicians], and probably lead to acts of violence in [Washington

   Perhaps a greater percentage of our prospective college students would
   be prepared if we did not try to send everyone with an IQ above 70 to
   college?
   Universities are accepting more unqualified students for the same
   reason that banks were, until recently, accepting more unqualified home
   buyers: the government subsidizes it and promotes the idea that it is
   "for everyone". Just as we "made home ownership affordable" and watched
   a bunch of people with no business buying a house do exactly that, we
   have "made college affordable", only to watch a bunch of people who
   have no business in college show up on campus with a pocket full of
   dreams (and Stafford Loans).
   Unprepared, underqualified students are logical and predictable
   outcomes of these sorts of choices, just as unprepared, underqualified
   homeowners were the logical result of our housing policies. In both
   cases, the government shields the institutions from risk, removing
   their incentive to keep up standards and turn away the unqualified.
   We asked for "college for everyone", and that's what we got: a
   government-subsidized, watered-down (so everyone can pass),
   vocationalized system of credentialing people for middle-class jobs.
   It's anything but a system of 'education'.
   And just as we see empty, abandoned houses all across America today, we
   are beginning to see unused and abandoned college degrees in the hands
   of our young people, who (like the homebuyers) had convinced themselves
   that their purchase was their ticket to the American Dream.

   Never took my SAT's. I have an associates degree in specialized
   technology. I am now in college again for Early Childhood Education, to
   get my bachelors. Top of my class with straight A's....... SAT's mean
   nothing.

   Well, the teabaggers and most communities expect teachers to teach very
   well, baby sit, do many duties that are the jobs of any parents as
   smart as a blow pop, be cheerful, upbeat, and get through to every kid.
   At less than minimum wages plus tips. I know. I'm an ex-teacher. I was
   a good one who got more appreciation when I left to teach in college.

   Education. I'm prepared for what i'm in for. Teaching things that are
   outdated by 2-3 years just so children can past test given by the
   government. Funny, I never took my SAT's yet im in college for a second
   time and I have straight A's..... my god to think I'll be teaching
   children someday.... GASP! lol
