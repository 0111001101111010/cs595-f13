  Research duo suggest early Earth had heat-pipe channels similar to Jupiter's
                                    moon Io

   Research duo suggest early Earth had heat-pipe channels similar to
   Jupiter’s moon Io [83]Enlarge

   Credit: Nature

   (Phys.org) —Two planetary researches, one from Hampton University and
   the National Institute of Aerospace, the other from Louisiana State
   University, have published a paper in the journal Nature suggesting
   that for a period of time, the Earth was very similar to Jupiter's moon
   Io—with heat from within being released through what are known as
   heat-pipes. The new theory by William Moore and Alexander Webb goes
   against the common consensus that the Earth transitioned directly from
   a planet with a hot molten liquid layer to one covered by tectonic
   plates.

   Planetary scientists have been stumped in trying to figure out how a
   planet with a molten hot [84]liquid surface could transition directly
   to one with tectonic plates—the only way that could happen would be if
   the planet cooled almost instantly. But all available evidence
   indicates it didn't, so how did the tectonic plates come about? Moore
   and Webb suggest there was an intermediate stage—one where heat was
   allowed to escape from the interior of the planet through heat-pipes.

   In practical terms, heat pipes are [85]soft material "holes" in a
   planet's surface. Hot [86]magma from below is pushed upwards through
   channels towards the surface where it flows out as lava allowing heat
   to escape into space. While very similar to volcanoes, they don't
   necessarily erupt, they simply ooze. Jupiter's moon Io is an excellent
   example of a body that oozes [87]lava, with so many heat-pipes that its
   entire surface is covered by material constantly pushed up from below.
   The result is a constant turnover of [88]surface material, mixing with
   that from below. Moore and Webb theorize that a very similar situation
   existed on Earth between the time the surface was hot molten liquid and
   the development of tectonic plates. They suggest the constant movement
   of material up though the heat-pipes led to a build-up on the surface.
   As the planet cooled over time, the material that was pushed up slowly
   hardened and became the [89]tectonic plates. And because there was
   still a lot of heat in the core of the planet, fissures developed which
   caused the plates to break apart and to travel as they continue to do
   today.

   Moore and Webb point to ancient zircon and diamonds found on Earth to
   strengthen their theory—the rocks have been dated to the time period in
   question (roughly 3 to 4 billion years ago) and show the weathering
   that would have occurred had they been constantly churned by heat-pipe
   transport.

   hotspot volcanoes

   More information: Heat-pipe Earth, Nature 501, 501–505 (26 September
   2013) [91]DOI: 10.1038/nature12473

   Abstract
   The heat transport and lithospheric dynamics of early Earth are
   currently explained by plate tectonic and vertical tectonic models, but
   these do not offer a global synthesis consistent with the geologic
   record. Here we use numerical simulations and comparison with the
   geologic record to explore a heat-pipe model in which volcanism
   dominates surface heat transport. These simulations indicate that a
   cold and thick lithosphere developed as a result of frequent volcanic
   eruptions that advected surface materials downwards. Declining heat
   sources over time led to an abrupt transition to plate tectonics.
   Consistent with model predictions, the geologic record shows rapid
   volcanic resurfacing, contractional deformation, a low geothermal
   gradient across the bulk of the lithosphere and a rapid decrease in
   heat-pipe volcanism after initiation of plate tectonics. The heat-pipe
   Earth model therefore offers a coherent geodynamic framework in which
   to explore the evolution of our planet before the onset of plate
   tectonics.
