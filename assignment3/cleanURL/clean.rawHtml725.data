   Published on May 22, 2013

   Pry is the featureful development console for Ruby. From its humble
   roots as an irb replacement, Pry has grown into an indispensable tool
   for any Ruby or Rails programmer.
   Using some real-life examples, I'll explain how to use Pry effectively.
   We'll start from the beginning, with simple features for exploring
   libraries and source-code in glorious technicolor. Then we'll move up a
   level and discuss how to inspect, debug and even modify a program while
   it is still running. Finally we'll touch on some of Pry's more advanced
   plugins that can really help you get a feel for what your code is
   doing.
