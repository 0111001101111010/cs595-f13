You've Come A Long Way Baby

   By the title you may think I'm speaking of women's equality and the
   famous saying of the 70's, but no, I am talking about the Nerd
   movement. Hi, my name is Flippity Trippity and I am a nerd. I enjoy
   board games, Star Wars movies, trivia (both useful and useless),
   cartoons, documentaries, and often I speak in obscure references to
   express my thoughts or feelings.
   [5][nerd.jpg]
   In the eighties nerds were portrayed as spectacle wearing geniuses who
   knew only of the opposite sex via medical journals and longed to be
   friends with the in-crowd. Many of you might remember the film,
   "Revenge of the Nerds" as a footnote to what I've just mentioned. Not
   much has changed since. Nerds are hardly portrayed in a favorable light
   but all of that is hogwash. Sure there are a few stereotypical "nerds"
   who live up to such a portrayal, but most of us are semi-normal people
   carrying on semi-normal lives, which is by most accounts, quite normal.
   In fact, nerds are so normal that you might even be a nerd yourself and
   not even know it. And if you don't know if you are a nerd or not, there
   are ways of finding out. Here are a few signs that might indicate you
   already are, or are one your way to becoming a nerd.
   1. Dialogue
   You and your coworkers are discussing a movie or show around the water
   cooler and you make a reference towards Star Wars, history, or
   scientific/social theory into the conversation. Furthermore, your go-to
   grub shirt or drinking at home alone shirt, celebrates something
   "nerdy".
   Example (a) - yes, nerds tell you when they are about to give examples,
   such as a shirt with a physics equation.
   [6]physics - it's the sudden deceleration that kills shirt
   [7]physics - it's the sudden deceleration that kills by [8]strk3
   Use Zazzle's [9]shirt designer
   Example (b) - a classic obscure reference shirt, such as Monty Python's
   Holy Grail

   2. Movies
   A lot of people don't realize the type of movie a person watches says a
   lot about who they are, or who they are not, or who they want to be.
   Which basically means, what you watch could or could not indicate who
   you are. I guess they aren't really a solid litmus test for anything so
   how about we just say, nerds usually gravitate towards certain movies.
   Star Wars and Star Trek are obvious ones, but did you know you might be
   a nerd if you like:
   Monty Python and the Holy Grail
   Any self respecting nerd covets their Holy Grail. How can you not love
   a movie that has "coconut" horses, a killer bunny rabbit, and a musical
   number so powerful it inspired the Broadway play "Spamalot"?
   Lastly, one of the unsuspecting ways of telling if you are a nerd or
   not are board games. If in fact you do play games that come from a box
   and do not require the use of a television set or electricity, you may
   be a nerd. However, if your game of choice only requires a cup,
   ping-pong ball and beer, then don't worry, you are not a nerd - just an
   alcoholic.
   Scattergories
   Scrabble is the obvious choice of nerdy game players, but I also love
   this wordy game. If you've never played, the skinny is this - a die is
   rolled to choose a letter and you have to come up with as many "x"
   lettered words for various categories before time runs out to score
   points.
   Risk
   True hardcore nerds will go for Axis and Allies, but more moderately
   afflicted nerds will have a copy of Risk laying around for impromptu
   weekend gatherings. World domination is the name of the game. Alliances
   are made, alliances are broken, and in the end it's a great way to
   spend a few hours with some friends.
   There you have it, a handful of Nerd-i-cators to decide if you are or
   aren't a Nerd. Regardless of what you are, Nerd or not, enjoy your life
   and appreciate everyone around you.
