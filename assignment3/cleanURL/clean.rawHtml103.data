Our Culture

   We're not the kind of company that believes that a few Diet Cokes is
   enough to keep someone happy; although we do have a well-stocked
   fridge, we offer a whole lot more:

Autonomy

   We work and iterate fast, and allow individual staff to define the
   techniques and tools that they use for each project. Think something's
   wrong with the way we do things? You can change it. We actively
   encourage side projects of all shapes and sizes and will provide you
   with anything you need to execute an amazing idea.

Friday Hacks

   We spend every Friday afternoon (typically following a trip to the pub
   for lunch) flexing our creative muscles. Whether it's open sourcing
   something awesome we've made, experimenting with a new language or
   [3]controlling a quadrocopter with Node.js, Friday afternoon is for
   trying new things and making something cool. There's no limitations,
   and there's no such thing as a bad idea. No work, no pressure, and lots
   of creativity (and beer).

Flexible Holidays

   Need a break? It's really simple: take one. Our holiday policy alows
   you to take as much holiday as you need, whenever you need it.

Choose Your Tools

   We'll make sure you get the setup and working environment you need to
   excel at your what you do. Whether it's an iMac, a 3D printer or just a
   hardback book, we'll make sure nothing gets in your way.

Travel & Network

   Pack your toothbrush, we're going on a cruise. We have offices in
   London and LA and encourage you work in as many environments as we can
   offer. We have a generous conference budget and encourage the
   attendence of industry events. We regularly attend hackathons, and win
   a lot too (hurrah!).

Your Work Matters

   We work with some of the largest brands and agencies on the planet.
   Your work here will at times digitally touch hundreds of thousands of
   people at any given moment. That sensation is something we believe is
   truly like no other - the work you do here will create a huge impact on
   the world.
