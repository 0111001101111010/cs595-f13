     * Soooo Fast!
       Performance is our #1 goal. Every component we design is
       [6]benchmarked for performance. You can see our results.
     * Components Galore
       We have the building blocks to get you up and running fast. Our
       growing set of components were born from CSS.
     * Themeable
       Is that even a word? It should be! We love our theme, but we donâ€™t
       want to hit your brand over the head with it. Just add colors and
       voila!
     * BEM Architecture
       We believe CSS is ready for primetime. We are basing our
       [7]architecture on BEM make your apps faster, less contextual and
       easier to manage.
     * Even our font is open source
       The first open source font family contribution from Adobe, Source
       Sans Pro. It is served on [8]Adobe Edge Web Fonts and [9]Adobe
       Typekit.
     * Icons how you want them
       We created over [10]100 icons to go with Topcoat. You can use them
       as SVG, PNG or semantic icon font. And yes, they are also open
       source.
     * Design with Topcoat
       Even though Topcoat was designed in code. We are [11]including a
       PSD with all the components on our code base.
