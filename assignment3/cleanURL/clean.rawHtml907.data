[113]Icefog: The Hacker Crew Trying to Break Into Your Weapons

Posted By [114]John Reed [091022_meta_block.gif] Wednesday, September 25,
2013 - 9:17 PM [091022_meta_block.gif] [115][091022_more_icon.gif] Share

   [icefog.jpg]

   A new cyber-theft ring from Asia is committing a string of smash and
   grab-style attacks against suppliers to major military contractors.
   This isn't just any hacker crew; its targeting of defense
   subcontractors means it could easily undermine the integrity of the
   world's weapons.

   This new crew, dubbed Icefog by Kaspersky Lab, is small and nimble, and
   it appears to know exactly what it wants to steal from its victims.
   Unlike some other advanced hacker outfits that linger on victims'
   networks for months or years after gaining access, the Icefog crew
   doesn't stick around waiting to get caught.

   "They will infiltrate an organization. They know exactly what they are
   looking for, pull it out, and as soon as they complete their assignment
   they move on -- they actually clean things up and move on," said Kurt
   Baumgartner, a security researcher with Kaspersky, during a speech in
   Washington today.

   Kaspersky researchers think the people behind Icefog are based in
   China, South Korea, and Japan.

   Icefog attacked several hundred victims -- everything from TV stations,
   satellite operators, maritime logistics firms, communications
   businesses, defense contractors, and shipbuilders, according to
   Kaspersky. Most of the victims are in South Korea and Japan, but
   victims have been found everywhere from China to Belarus. There are
   also "strong suggestions that there were Western targets, including the
   U.S.," said Baumgartner.

   The crew steals "sensitive documents and company plans, e-mail account
   credentials, and passwords to access various resources inside and
   outside the victim's network," reads Kaspersky's [116]press release.
   "They look for specific filenames, which are quickly identified, and
   transferred to" Icefog.

   Most alarming are the crew's attacks against smaller parts suppliers to
   major defense contractors. Icefog's hackers could break into the poorly
   defended network of a defense subcontractor and plant destructive
   malware inside its products before they are placed in a weapon such as
   a fighter jet.

   This "creates a lot of problems because not only is there potential for
   economic espionage ... there's the chance for low-scale sabotage with
   destructive attacks that bring a whole new set of challenges," said
   Baumgartner.

   One South Korean company that Icefog was interested in "provides
   heads-up displays for F-15s, and they provide radar jamming for F-16s"
   used by Seoul's air force, said Baumgartner. He would not reveal
   whether the firm, LIG Nex1, had actually been penetrated by Icefog.

   This past July, David Shedd, deputy director of the U.S. Defense
   Intelligence Agency, [117]warned that foreign intelligence agencies are
   trying to do exactly that to American military suppliers.

   "Our adversaries are very active in trying to introduce material into
   the supply chain in ways that threaten our security from the standpoint
   of their abilities to collect [intelligence] and disrupt" U.S. military
   operations, said Shedd.

   Making things worse is that the United States doesn't have a true
   understanding of how vulnerable its supply chain is to this style of
   attack.

   "I'm generally an optimist, [but] in the supply chain area, I'm very
   concerned," said Shedd, given that he doesn't truly know the full
   extent of adversary penetration into DOD weapons systems. "You don't
   know what you don't know, and the old adage of the weakest link is
   obviously what we need to be concerned about."

   That's exactly the link Icefog is pounding. Baumgartner said the small,
   well-funded crew of "cyber-mercenaries" develops new attack techniques
   for each target. This makes Icefog incredibly hard to track since
   researchers have a hard time connecting individual attacks to one
   another - before it's too late.
