Episode 10 TitaniumPhysicists101

Jul 774 minutes

   Ben stops work on his Higgs Boson and climbs out of his Black Hole to
   talk Science and Podcasting with us! If you're at all familiar with
   "The Big Bang Theory" both the TV show or the real deal...then you must
   check this episode out! We chat about getting interviews with the big
   people and how that could disrupt the flow of your podcast...or not.
   Depends on thier interest. How important the regular release of a show
   is to your audience and how to go about building said audience. The
   interesting thing about Titanium Physicists Podcast is that it's all
   done over SKYPE. Ben's co-hosts and guests are scattered across the
   globe so he talks a great deal in putting a show together via different
   kinds of editing software. This is both a fun, funny podcast with a ton
   of information thrown at you. So get out your notepad and take notes
   because Ben is a great teacher and he loves giving tests! Contact us!
