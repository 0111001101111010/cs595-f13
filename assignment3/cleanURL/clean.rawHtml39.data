   Customers

   In the past, I've been evaluating many Python IDE's and editors
   available, since I can't live without a decent IDE with syntax
   highlighting and code completion. For my school projects I implemented
   mostly Python applications with web front-ends, built with Django or
   Flask frameworks and this is the area where PyCharm excels. Its
   debugger helped me to sort out many problems that would otherwise take
   hours to pinpoint. I recommend PyCharm to everyone who's looking for a
   Python IDE and I've got used to the PyCharm so much that I'll
   definitely buy a developer license for my personal/professional use
   after finishing the school.

   Says Jan Cermak, a student working now on master thesis called
   "Database of new synthetic drugs? at Institute of Chemical Technology,
   Prague, Czech Republic

   PyCharm, with the IdeaVim plugin, offers enough parity with Vim to make
   me happy despite having a few warts, while the editor’s code
   navigation, refactoring tools, test runner, debugger and other features
   I will discuss in this review keep me more focused and joyful than I
   have ever been writing code.

   Says Andrew Brookins, an experienced developer who has tried different
   text editors and tools for Python and Web development, in his amazingly
   comprehensive review [37]One Year Later: An Epic Review of PyCharm 2.7
   from a Vim User’s Perspective.
