About Ginga

   Ginga is a viewer for astronomical data FITS (Flexible Image Transport
   System) files.

   The Ginga viewer centers around a new FITS display widget which
   supports zooming and panning, color and intensity mapping, a choice of
   several automatic cut levels algorithms and canvases for plotting
   scalable geometric forms. In addition to this widget, the fits viewer
   provides a flexible plugin framework for extending the viewer with many
   different features. A fairly complete set of "standard" plugins are
   provided for features that we expect from a modern viewer: panning and
   zooming windows, star catalog access, cuts, star pick/fwhm, thumbnails,
   etc.

Etymology

   "Ginga" is the romanized spelling of the Japanese word "銀河" (hiragana:
   ぎんが), meaning "galaxy" (in general) and, more familiarly, the Milky
   Way. This viewer was written by software engineers at [10]Subaru
   Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan--thus the
   connection.

Pronunciation

   Ginga the viewer may be pronounced "ging-ga" (proper japanese) or
   "jing-ga" (perhaps easier for western tongues). The latter
   pronunciation has meaning in the Brazilian dance/martial art capoeira:
   a fundamental rocking or back and forth swinging motion.
