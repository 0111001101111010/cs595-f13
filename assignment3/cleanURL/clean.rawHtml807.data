10 Things No One Told You About Applying to College

   By [84]Rachel Bennett in [85]Career Lists
   Posted Sep 23 2013 - 12:00am
   Tagged With: [86]college applications

   As you’re starting the college application process (if you haven’t
   already, you overachievers), most people will be telling you one thing:
   what college you should go to.

   gilmore girls, gilmore girls graduation

   Like Rory Gilmore of Gilmore Girls, you may have your heart set on
   Harvard, but your grandparents are pressuring you to go to Yale. Okay,
   we all can’t be Rory and have to decide between Harvard and Yale, but
   you get the point.

   Once you start filling out those applications, everyone will tell you
   where you should spend the best four years of your life. But what
   aren’t these people telling you?

   Luckily for you, Her Campus is telling you the 10 things no one told
   you about applying to college, so you’ll be even more prepared to make
   your decision by the time you’ve received all of those acceptance
   letters.

   10. The application process can put a strain on friendships and
   relationships.

   Yes, even though you and your best friends compare yourselves to The
   Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, applying to college can hurt even
   the best sisterhoods. Some of you may stress out about the process
   while others don’t, one of you may get into your dream school and
   another doesn’t, and you may be able to pay for college even though
   your BFF can’t. A number of situations like these can affect a
   friendship, and honestly, some friendships end when high school does.
   But as Brandeis University collegiette Asya Bashina says, “The ones
   that do stick around will be your close friends.”

   As you’re applying to colleges, make sure you and your friends agree to
   be supportive of each other, no matter what happens. And if you do get
   into an argument over schools, talk to each other about it. Applying to
   college is a sensitive subject, and some people may not realize when
   they’ve hit a nerve. “I had one friend who, when I told her I was
   applying to Yale just to see if I would get in, told me I was not Yale
   material, just Cornell material, and I actually cried,” says
   Northwestern student Katherine Mirani. “We talked about it after
   everything was over and both realized how messed up the whole thing
   was. She had no idea that she was saying something offensive, and I
   should have seen the comment for the college-crazed mishap it was and
   let it go.”

   If you’re in a relationship, talk to your boyfriend about what colleges
   you’re applying to. What will happen to your relationship if you get
   into a school that he doesn’t, or vice versa? Communication is key
   during the college admissions process. If you and those close to you
   can get through the college application process, as well as the actual
   transition to college, then you can pretty much survive anything.

   9. Labels stop mattering after high school.

   While who’s popular, who’s a braniac, and so on may dominate most of
   your thoughts in high school, you should know these labels stop
   mattering after graduation. Why is it important to know this as you’re
   applying to college? Because you shouldn’t feel like you have to
   compete with your classmates to get into the best schools. During my
   senior year, I was accepted and almost went to a great school that not
   many people had heard of. I ended up going to a better-known school,
   and even though I have grown to love it, I think the lesser-known
   school would’ve been the best fit for me. If you apply to schools that
   not many people have heard of or ones that are labelled as “easy” to
   get into, be proud of that. Going to college is a great achievement no
   matter what school it is. Just because others may not see what’s so
   great about a school doesn’t mean it isn’t the best place for you.

   8. Your dream school may change.

   Just like Rory, who had dreamed of going to Harvard only to discover
   she loved Yale more, your dream school may change as you’re going
   through the application process. While some of you may accept this
   decision with open arms, others of you may be hesitant about this
   sudden change of heart. How can you change your mind when you have been
   set on one school for your entire life?! Don’t worry – it’s going to be
   okay. This happens, and if you really fall in love with another school,
   don’t question yourself or be afraid to change your mind.

   USC collegiette Rebecca Buddingh had planned on going to Boston
   University since her freshman year of high school, but once she
   received an acceptance letter, she realized she didn’t want to leave
   her home state of California. “I decided that my new ‘dream school’ was
   USC, and the day I got in was one of the best days of my life!” Rebecca
   says. “I'm incredibly happy that I changed my mind my second semester
   of senior year!” As Rebecca found out, it’s never too late to change
   your mind about what school is best for you.

   7. If you don’t get into your dream school, it’s not the end of the
   world.

   Your best friend got into the school you’ve been dying to go to since
   you were three years old, and you didn’t. Go ahead – have a good cry.
   But after you’ve used up three boxes of tissues and eaten four pints of
   Ben & Jerry’s, pick yourself back up and come up with a new plan. This
   has happened to many collegiettes, and while it’s not the ideal
   situation, sometimes it turns out to be for the best. As you look into
   other schools, you may realize you like another school better than your
   dream school. Or it may actually take attending another school for you
   to realize that your dream school wasn’t for you after all.

   Bucknell University collegiette Cameron Simcik says she thought her
   life was over when she was waitlisted at Boston College, but she
   eventually found that Bucknell was the best place for her. “I’m so glad
   I didn’t get into BC, because I now realize it wouldn’t have been a
   good fit!” Cameron says. “I always try and tell people to keep an open
   mind when it comes to colleges because you never know where you’re
   meant to be!”

   6. Always (we repeat: ALWAYS) apply to multiple safety schools.
   accepted stamp

   So you’ve applied to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Brown.
   You’re bound to get into one, right? Not necessarily. No matter how
   high of a GPA you have, always apply to a few safety schools (schools
   that you are likely get into) in case those Ivy Leagues or other top
   tier schools send rejection letters. And by a few, we don’t mean just
   one – you aren’t guaranteed a spot at a safety school, either. Apply to
   two or three safety schools just to be safe, but don’t apply to the
   first three you can think of. Take a break from decorating your room
   with Harvard memorabilia and do some research to find safety schools
   you like and could see yourself attending. Even if these schools aren’t
   your dream schools, it’s better to have them to fall back on than to
   have nowhere to go.
