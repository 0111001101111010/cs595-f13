   There‚Äôs something about a piano and a voice!  When you combine this
   with great songs, it can be magic.

   Our guest this week brings these three things together in perfect
   harmony! Andrew Walesch knows how to tickle the ivories; is passionate
   about songs from The Great American Songbook; and, is affectionately
   known as the ‚Äúboy with the voice!‚Äù

   So glad to be able to introduce you to this great musician.  Catch him
   on YouTube singing [21]‚ÄúOctober Song‚Äù.

About Andrew Walesch

   [22]Andrew Walesch

   Andrew Walesch

   A newer face on the Minnesota music scene, [23]Andrew Walesch maintains
   a very active performance schedule. An in demand singer and pianist,
   Andrew is known most notably for his unique approach to ‚Äî and almost
   obsessive knowledge of ‚Äî [24]The Great American Songbook. He certainly
   ventures outside of jazz and the standards, however, and can be found
   anywhere from a classy cocktail lounge to a rugged piano bar taking
   requests from just about every genre.

   More recently Andrew has focused on songwriting and is working on a
   project of originals. Andrew has recorded two albums and has sung and
   played on the stage of the Chicago Theater, the Dakota Jazz Club in
   Minneapolis and dozens of venues all over the Midwest. In May of 2010,
   he graduated with a music degree from St. John‚Äôs University,
   Collegeville, MN. Whether recording jingles, producing shows, composing
   and arranging, or singing as a solo artist and with big bands all over
   the Midwest, ‚Äúthe boy with the voice,‚Äù is known for winning crowds
   over.
