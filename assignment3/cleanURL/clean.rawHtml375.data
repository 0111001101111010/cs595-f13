How to use a custom font in your WordPress website

Fed up of Arial and Verdana?  Using a custom font on your WordPress blog is a
great way to get a unique look that encompasses your brand’s style.

There are several plugins that claim to help you install a custom font, but
to be honest most of them are harder work than setting it up yourself!

   Below is a step-by-step guide to embedding a new font.  To keep things
   simple, I’ll be using a fresh install of WordPress using the default
   Twenty Thirteen theme.

   Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like before any changes
   have been made:

1. Select a font

   I will be using [13]FuturaLT.  Before installing any font on your
   website check the licensing documentation to ensure that you have the
   right to use it online.   You will need to have the font as either a
   TrueTypeFile (TTF) or OpenTypeFile (OTF) in order to convert for web
   use.

2. Convert the font to an @ face

   Whilst it’s possible to create the different formats yourself, the
   easiest way is using a great tool called [15]Font Squirrel.

   Click on Add Font and upload your selected font.  Click the ‘Optimal’
   setting and check the box to confirm that your chosen font is eligible
   for web embedding.  Then click on ‘Get your kit’.

   Extract the files contained within the zipped folder.  You will notice
   that there are several file types.  The first one to open is
   Stylesheet.css which should look similar to this:
   [17]Font Stylesheet.css

   Font Style.css

   Copy the code into the top of the Stylesheet.css of your chosen
   template (this is found in the WordPress Dashboard – Appearance –
   Editor – Style.css).

3.  Upload your font files

   The four files you need to upload are the eot, svg, ttf and woff
   formats.  Copy these to the base directory of your chosen theme.

4. Define your fonts in Style.css

   Look out for my forthcoming video in which we’ll go one step further by
   creating a dedicated fonts folder and setting up several different
   fonts (useful for headings / captions / body text).

   I hope you’ve found this post useful and informative.  Do try it and
   let me know how you get on in the comments below.
