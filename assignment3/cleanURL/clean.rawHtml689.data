Active Merchant

A Ruby library for dealing with credit cards and payment processors.

   Active Merchant is an extraction from the [12]e-commerce software
   solution Shopify. Shopify's requirements for a simple and unified API
   to access dozens of different payment gateways with very different
   internal APIs was the chief principle in designing the library.

   Active Merchant has been in production use since June 2006 and is now
   used in most modern Ruby applications which deal with financial
   transactions. It is maintained by the [13]Shopify and [14]Spreedly
   teams, with much help from an ever-growing set of contributors.

   It was developed to for usage in Ruby on Rails web applications and
   integrates seamlessly as a plugin but it also works excellently as a
   stand alone library.

What does it look like?

   # Send requests to the gateway's test servers
   ActiveMerchant::Billing::Base.mode = :test

   # Create a new credit card object
   credit_card = ActiveMerchant::Billing::CreditCard.new(
     :number     => '4111111111111111',
     :month      => '8',
     :year       => '2009',
     :first_name => 'Tobias',
     :last_name  => 'Luetke',
     :verification_value  => '123'
   )

   if credit_card.valid?
     # Create a gateway object to the TrustCommerce service
     gateway = ActiveMerchant::Billing::TrustCommerceGateway.new(
       :login    => 'TestMerchant',
       :password => 'password'
     )

     # Authorize for $10 dollars (1000 cents)
     response = gateway.authorize(1000, credit_card)

     if response.success?
       # Capture the money
       gateway.capture(1000, response.authorization)
     else
       raise StandardError, response.message
     end
   end
