   The best way to calm down is so innate to our lives, we often take it
   for granted: Taking a breath.

   Focusing on your own breathing can have a significant impact on your
   well-being and stress levels, and can even create physiological changes
   like lowering your blood pressure. But for many of us, when it comes to
   improving our health, changing our breathing somehow doesn’t spring to
   mind as readily as changing our diet or exercise habits.

   "We take our breath for granted the way we take our heart beat for
   granted," Carla Ardito, a breathing expert at Manhattan's Integral Yoga
   Institute and creator of the [273]Breathing Lessons app, told The
   Huffington Post. "The difference is we can work on our breathing."

   And there’s plenty of precedent. For thousands of years, the yogic
   practice of pranayama (Sanskrit for "extension of the life-force") has
   been used as a method geared towards reducing stress and healing the
   body and mind through targeted breathing exercises.

   Check out the infographic below for seven health benefits of focusing
   on your breathing.

   [274]in the iTunes App store, available Friday, Sept. 13.

     * Easy Forward Bend (variation of Sukhasana)
       The easy forward bend pose is accessible even to beginners, and
       it's a great one to try before bedtime. If you're tight in the
       hips, Bielkus advises sitting on top of a pillow to make the pose a
       bit more relaxing. "This one is good for sleep," says Bielkus. "It
       also eases tension and lets the hips open up, and just creates an
       overall sense of ease in the body."
     * Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana)
       To perform this pose, stand with the feet about six inches apart
       and fold the torso to the ground, reaching toward the ground or
       bending the arms and grabbing opposite hand to opposite elbow. In
       addition to helping to relieve headaches and insomnia, the pose can
       also be helpful for lowering stress levels, <a
       href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/478"
       target="_blank">according to Yoga Journal</a>. "Sway a little side
       to side and breathe," says Bielkus. "Bend the knees as much as
       needed to ease any strain. Tension in the legs and hips will start
       to release."
     * Child's Pose (Balasana)
       The quintessential resting pose in many yoga classes, child's pose
       helps to calm the mind and relieve tension in the body. Fold the
       torso over the legs with the arms extended or by the sides, and
       rest the forehead on the ground. "Take long deep breaths," Bielkus
       suggests. "Massage the forehead left to right easing tension at the
       brow point."
     * Plow Pose (Halasana)
       Yoga Journal <a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/479"
       target="_blank">recommends </a>staying in the plow pose for one to
       five minutes to fall asleep easier. Lie down on your back, lifting
       your legs over your head and then to the ground behind you, with
       your hands either on your back for support or on the floor. "By
       turning the flow of blood around, you bring new vitality into the
       body," says Bielkus.
     * Legs Up The Wall Pose (Viparita Karani)
       This simple pose, performed against a wall, is excellent for
       evening relaxation and stress relief. Bielkus recommends staying in
       the pose for as long as five minutes, with the eyes closed and
       using a soothing eye pillow if desired. "When we flip the legs up,
       the blood can rush back down to the heart," says Bielkus. "It has a
       soothing quality."
     * Corpse Pose (Savasana)
       Get your body into sleep mode with a simple corpse pose, focusing
       the attention on the body and breath, and letting go of the day's
       worries. "By focusing the mind and bringing awareness in, you take
       the mind off of what is causing stress or restlessness," says
       Bielkus.
     * Supine Spinal Twist (Supta Matsyendrasana)
       This reclining twisted pose can easily be performed in bed before
       you fall asleep. Lie down on your back and bring the right knee
       into your chest and then across your left side. Extend the right
       arm out and gaze to the right, taking several deep breaths and then
       repeating on the other side. You can also try bringing both legs up
       and then over to each side, as pictured at left. "Gentle twists
       relieve tension throughout the whole spine and also aid in
       digestion and help us rinse out some tension from the day," Bielkus
       says.
     * Seated Spinal Twist (Ardha Matsyendrasana)
       Like the supine twist, the seated spinal twist (also known as the
       half lord of the fishes pose) can create a sense of relaxation in
       the body while gently stretching the spine. The stretch can be
       practiced with both legs bent or with one outstretched.
     * Reclining Butterfly (Supta Baddha Konasana)
       A variation of the basic butterfly pose (pictured at left), the
       reclining butterfly can help the body get into rest mode. Lie down
       on your back -- on your bed or on a mat -- and bring the feet
       together, splaying out the knees in a diamond. If your hips are
       tight and the pose feels too intense, Bielkus suggests putting a
       folded blanket or cushion under each of the knees. "Bring one hand
       to your heart and one hand to your belly," Bielkus says. "Breathe
       deeply observing the breath move in and out of the body."
     * Left Nostril Breathing (Surya Bhedana)
       To try this relaxing breathing exercise (<em>pranayama</em>), you
       can either sit up crossed-legged or lie down on your right side.
       Cover the right nostril with your thumb and extend the fingers out.
       Then take five to 10 deep breathes out of your left nostril. "If I
       can't sleep ... As soon as I've done three left nostril breaths,
       I'm out," says Bielkus. "It's really, really effective."

   All of these articles and links are great. I have been looking or one
   source that I can find information on many traditions and techniques
   around stress reduction and meditation. The only place that seems to
   have a little of everything is [315]www.meditation.com. It looks like
   they are new but there are new things there every day.
   Can any one tell me if there are any better sources ?

   Diaphragmatic breathing is awesomesauce.
   The trick is to find a balance between forcing your breath (can get
   wierd) and doing nothing. Just work with it like a smartphone app,
   playing with it at least once a day. It might take as much as a few
   years if you work on it only occasionally. But in a pretty short time
   and without any crushing effort it shifts. It seems almost like once
   your body gets a taste for it, it wants More.
   Working this way you will find yourself naturally falling into it more
   and more until it's hard to remember how you used to breathe any other
   way. It's been a wonder for me in working with PTSD. When panic arises
   my breath is always there and free of charge. If you practice with it
   you will automatically take a few quick breaths the moment stress
   arises. It's like dropping an anchor down through a storm of thought
   right to your body, keeping you steady so you can stand firm through
   those red waves of mental chatter and emotion until the storm blows
   over. Instead of being swept completely up in it.

   Meditation is wonderful. Why it works? When you are fully aware of your
   breathing, you not aware of your thoughts, and therefore are not
   placing conditions on them - whether they are good or bad. When we are
   so wrapped in our own opinion & bias - we are not in the moment of
   truth. Truth is holds no opinion or judgements. Personal judgements
   whether you are a Progressive or Conservative is sustained through
   selfishness & ego.

   Watch a baby or a dog or a cat sleep. They breathe from their
   diaphragm, so their bellies expand. Humans learn to breathe from their
   chests instead of their diaphragms, so they end up not using all of
   their lung capacity.
   I took a tai chi course many moons ago and was taught diaphragmatic
   breathing. It was probably the best money I ever spent for my health
   considering the bang for the buck.

   I also watched my dogs sleeping and when they breathe their entire body
   moves even their necks and heads. We have become breathers from the
   neck down and this is also not optimum. The lower abdomen moves the
   most but there is subtle movement everywhere when you breathe well.
