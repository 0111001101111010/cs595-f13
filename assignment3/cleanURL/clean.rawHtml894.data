   On Friday, the U.S. government [26]filed its brief in the appeal of
   Andrew "Weev" Auernheimer, who was convicted of federal hacking charges
   for downloading hundreds of thousands of customer e-mail addresses from
   AT&T's Web site. The government says the conviction was proper, but
   many security researchers and civil liberties advocates argue that the
   conviction would set a dangerous precedent. Confused? Read on.

   Who's Weev?

   Weev's real name is Andrew Auernheimer. He's a security researcher and
   Internet provocateur who is facing felony hacking charges. No one,
   including Auernheimer himself, would [27]describe him as a nice guy.
   But his case raises important questions about the freedom to conduct
   computer security research and to use software to gather information
   online.

   What is Auernheimer being prosecuted for?

   In 2010, Auernheimer and a colleague discovered that AT&T had
   accidentally published the private e-mail addresses of its iPad
   customers to an AT&T-owned Web site. Auernheimer then wrote automated
   software to harvest the e-mail addresses of more than 100,000 iPad
   users. He [28]passed this information to Gawker.

   The government argues that Auernheimer should have known that AT&T's
   Web site wasn't intended to be available to the general public and that
   that should have stopped him from harvesting its customers' e-mail
   addresses. The feds point out that Auernheimer configured his software
   to falsely tell the AT&T server that it was running on an iPad. And the
   government argues that the process Auernheimer used to download the
   e-mail addresses involved inappropriately impersonating AT&T customers.

   Using automated software to harvest peoples' private information sounds
   pretty sketchy. It's good for the feds to put a stop to that kind of
   thing, right?

   Most ordinary users have neither the skills nor the inclination to set
   up automatic harvesting of information from Web sites. But this
   technique, known as "scraping," is surprisingly common among
   technologically sophisticated users and has a number of legitimate
   applications.

   For example, in 2006, Wired journalist Kevin Poulsen [29]launched a
   project to identify sex offenders who might be trolling MySpace for
   minors. Obviously, searching for every name in the sex offender
   registry by hand wouldn't have been practical, but Poulsen figured out
   he could automate the process with software.

   To get a list of sex offenders, Poulsen [30]wrote an automated program
   to search the Department of Justice Web site for each zip code in the
   United States and then save the name and address of each registered sex
   offender in that zip code to a file.

   Unfortunately, Poulsen said, his initial search got him "temporarily
   blocked" from the site because the Department of Justice "doesn't like
   you running a lot of queries back-to-back." So he added a 30-second
   delay between queries. That "seemed to satisfy the server," but it
   lengthened the time it took to download the entire database to 71
   hours.

   There are some striking similarities between Poulsen's actions and
   Auernheimer's. Both used automated software to harvest information from
   a Web site. Both used the Web site in ways that probably weren't
   intended by their designers. Both took technical measures to avoid Web
   site operators' efforts to discourage their activities.

   Yet most people would agree that Poulsen's actions were a legitimate
   journalistic project. So we might want to be careful about subjecting
   this kind of technique to criminal penalties.

   Come on, Poulsen was once convicted for computer hacking before he
   began his career as a journalist. And this sort of thing still seems
   creepy. Aren't we better off without hackers poking around other
   peoples' Web sites?

   Poulsen is far from the only person who has used "scraping" techniques
   for legitimate purposes. Academics use them to gather data sets for
   later analysis. Businesses use them to gather data, such as prices and
   product descriptions, from competitors' Web sites. That can benefit the
   public by making the market more competitive. The Electronic Frontier
   Foundation, a public interest group, [31]scrapes corporate Web sites to
   detect when they make changes to their terms of service.

   "Over the past fifteen years, virtually every organization,
   corporation, and government on the planet has published information on
   the web," wrote the legal scholar Paul Ohm in [32]a 2006 article. "The
   problem with this data is it's trapped within the four corners of web
   pages."

   Ohm believes that legal academics could do better research if they
   learned to write Web-scraping software. "Scraping frees data, allowing
   it to be used in an endless number of new ways," he argued.

   Yeah, but Auernheimer didn't just scrape a publicly available Web site.
   He used shady techniques like impersonating an iPad. Isn't that wrong?

   When a Web browser requests a Web page from a Web server, it sends
   something called a user agent string to tell the server what kind of
   browser is requesting the page. The government faults Auernheimer for
   sending the user agent string of an iPad even though his software
   wasn't running on an iPad.

   This is another example of a technique that only sounds shady if you're
   not familiar with the conventions of the Web. This kind of user agent
   spoofing is extremely common online. Indeed, as security researcher
   [33]Robert Graham points out, since the 1990s, most major browsers have
   used a user agent string that starts with "Mozilla," the code name for
   the now-defunct Netscape Web browser. Microsoft began doing this
   because in the 1990s, Web servers would send different versions of
   their sites to different browsers. Netscape was viewed as the
   cutting-edge browser of its day, and so Internet Explorer pretended to
   be Netscape to trick Web servers into sending it the most sophisticated
   version of their site. Over the last decade, other browsers have
   followed suit, and now almost all browsers call themselves Mozilla even
   though most of them aren't derived from Mozilla software.

   Changing user agent strings has other uses too. In 2012, Orbitz was
   [34]accused of showing more expensive hotels to Mac users than PC
   users. Changing one's user agent (to pose as a Mac, then as a PC) is
   essential to investigating this kind of allegation.

   A Web developer might change a user agent string to that of an iPad so
   he or she can debug the iPad version of the Web site from a desktop Web
   browser. Indeed, changing user agent strings is so useful that Google's
   Chrome browser allows users to do it with [35]just four clicks. It
   would be crazy to make this extremely common technique a felony.

   What about impersonating AT&T users? That's problematic, right?

   This is probably the government's strongest argument. The AT&T Web site
   worked like this: Every iPad has a unique 19- or 20-digit ID called an
   [36]ICC-ID. AT&T set up a Web site that allowed an iPad to provide its
   ICC-ID and get the e-mail address of the iPad's owner in response.
   Auernheimer figured out that ICC-IDs come in a predictable order, and
   so he wrote a program to try a large number of possible ICC-IDs in
   sequence and ask the server for the e-mail address associated with each
   one.

   The government characterizes this as impersonating iPad users, and
   that's not a crazy way to think about it. But another way to think
   about it is that Auernheimer was simply asking the AT&T server, "What
   is the e-mail address associated with this ICC-ID?" And the AT&T server
   was configured to give an answer to anyone who asked.

   The Internet has a standard convention for marking a Web page
   off-limits: protecting it with a password. Accessing a Web page with a
   password that doesn't belong to you is, properly, illegal. If AT&T
   wanted to restrict access to its Web site, it could and probably should
   have protected the site with a password. It didn't do that.

   An ICC-ID is not a password. And while we might think Auernheimer
   should have had the good sense not to access data that wasn't intended
   for him, it's probably not reasonable to impose criminal penalties for
   this kind of misjudgment.

   Aurenheimer clearly knew he was doing something he wasn't supposed to.
   The government says he described his own actions as "theft." Shouldn't
   we expect people to be respectful of other peoples' property?

   Knowledge is power. Journalists, academics, security researchers and
   others work to uncover information that powerful institutions would
   like to keep secret. Demanding that everyone respect these
   institutions' right to control information about themselves is contrary
   to the principles of these professions.

   This is obvious in the case of journalists soliciting information from
   confidential sources. Sources give journalists information that
   powerful institutions want to keep secret, helping the public
   understand what these institutions are doing and hold them accountable.

   Precisely the same point applies to software-assisted
   information-gathering. The scraping that's most valuable to the public
   will often not be welcomed by the company or government whose Web site
   is being scraped. Such scraping can reveal trends or policies that the
   organization that runs the Web site might prefer to keep secret.

   Similarly, security research is often embarrassing to the technology
   vendor whose technology is being exposed as insecure. Yet the public
   benefits from having flaws discovered by relatively ethical security
   researchers instead of hackers who are prepared to use the information
   for nefarious purposes. If the law demanded that security researchers
   cease research that was unwelcome by technology vendors, a great deal
   of beneficial research would go undone.

   Matt Blaze, a computer security researcher at the University of
   Pennsylvania, recently [37]told me that the government's position, that
   Auernheimer should have known its Web site was off-limits, "essentially
   requires anyone doing Web-scale research to not just be ethical and
   honest but also to be a mind-reader."

   Such a vague standard isn't just unfair to journalists, security
   researchers and others who conduct software-aided research. It could
   also harm the general public by giving powerful institutions a weapon
   to use against researchers looking for embarrassing information about
   them that the public has the right to know.
