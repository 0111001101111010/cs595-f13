   12 Week Course in Web Development, starting on the 11th of November.
   (With a 2 week Xmas break from 20th Devember to 5th Jan)


   "Like Oxbridge meets the Royal Marines - but for people who want to
   Learn to Code"...


   Makers Academy is a highly-selective, 12 week, full-time program that
   teaches web development. We accept only the top applicants onto the
   course for a rigorous program that culminates with graduation (AKA
   hiring) day where we introduce them to London's top technology
   companies looking to hire entry-level developers.

   Our courses start every 6 weeks and the next course with space starts
   on the 11th of November.

   Check out [12]www.MakersAcademy.com for more information, more course
   dates, details of what you'll learn and how you'll learn it, and
   tuition fees.


   ****PLEASE NOTE****

   Tickets are for the next GRADUATION DAY, not for a place on the course.
   Graduation day will be a chance for you to see the kind of level of
   skills you could attain by the time you finish the course... It will
   also be an opportunity for you to check out Makers Academy, meet the
   Teachers, ask any questions you have and chat with current students.

   The event will be at 3pm on Friday the 20th of December.
