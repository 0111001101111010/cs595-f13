Semantic UI [53]0.3.1

UI is the vocabulary of the web.

   Semantic empowers designers and developers by creating a language for
   sharing UI.

   Semantic is structured around natural language conventions to make
   development more intuitive.

   Have a conversation with your components
   Semantic gives you a variety of UI components with real-time debug
   output, letting your code tell you what its doing.
   Open up your web console.
   Semantic provides tracing for javascript behavior so your components
   can tell you what they're doing as they do it.
