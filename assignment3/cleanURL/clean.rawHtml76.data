PullReview: Reach your Ruby Code Skill Walhalla

   [13]5 Replies

   TL;DR: PullReview is close to Beta now. In this post we’ll show you the
   ease of use, the code reviews, and how PullReview guides you to become
   a better Ruby developer.

   Some weeks ago, we [14]lifted a small part of the veil on PullReview,
   our automated code review tool for Ruby on Rails in Github. We told you
   why we are in this game: you’re a programming hero, and we want to
   provide everything to be the most magnificent one you can be.

   [15]Valhalla

   We think Code Review is [16]essential – programming life blood. That is
   why we are developing PullReview. As [17]our Alpha testers have driven
   us to a design we’re very comfortable with, we’re ready to show you
   some snippets of our Alpha version.

   This post has two goals: we want to show to you how PullReview is
   moving along, and we want to get you so curious that you’ll [18]sign up
   to the mailing list: you’ll be on the front row when we go into Beta ,
   we’ll have a shot at convincing you how PullReview is your new
   bestfriend for Ruby on Rails Code Review.

   Now that we’ve been completely open about that, let’s get to
   business. What will PullReview be doing for you? Two hints:

   • A Hero should be a Hero
   • Every Hero’s got a Learning Curve.

   A Hero should be a Hero

   What do we mean by that?

   You should focus on your core: delivering great – smooth functioning –
   features to your users. Not setting up servers and installing a
   plethora of tools. Your time – and your [19]flow – is too precious.

   The God Thor does not wait for the next train to get to his adventures.

   Equally, in programming, being the best you can be does nòt mean
   wasting time on coding activities that have nothing to do with your
   core competencies. That’s why PullReview is [20]SaaS – that’s why we
   have tried incorporating all relevant analysis in one tool.

   Simplicity starts at the sign up/login level:
     * Sign Up to PullReview
     * Log in to PullReview using your [21]Github account
     * Sync with your Github account
     * Pull your Branches and click “review”

   Simple.

   [22]PullReview Review Screen

   For the same reason, we put the most relevant Static Code Analysis
   tools under one hood. Once you pull a branch from Github to PullReview,
   PullReview analyzes your code for the following threats:
     * General Code Smell
     * Duplication
     * Complexity
     * Design
     * Style
     * Documentation
     * Test Infection

   [23]PullReview Analytics

   PullReview separates the issues encountered in alternative categories,
   looking at different aspects:
     * the ease of fixing a problem
     * the gravity of a problem
     * how you have progressed in fixing previous problems

   This way you get a good overview of the road you’ve travelled, the
   direction you’re taking now, and the one you should take.

   Every Hero’s got a Learning Curve

   Everyone needs to learn, and Everyone needs to Learn at his or her own
   pace.

   That’s why PullReview – for starters – doesn’t just tell you what is
   wrong in your code: it tells you what to do to make your code better.
   Every time you have pulled a review, you can click each problem and see
   explained what is wrong exactly, and what fix PullReview proposes.

   [24]PullReview expanded review and code guidance

   Not the what, but the how and the why. That’s how we all learn best.

   Secondly, everyone has his or her very own flow. It is exactly this
   flow that makes it a real pain in the *#$ to find a reviewer you can
   trust at a moment in time that suits your way of working. PullReview is
   ready when you are. Not only does PullReview’s availability help you
   improve more constantly, you can focus your time with your Peers for
   the larger challenges at hand: for the details that render your project
   truly magnificent.

   [25]PullReview Github Repositories Overview

   Cutting a long story short, this is PullReview:
     * [26]Code Reviews, right away
     * The most relevant static analysis, all in one place
     * True Code Reviews, guiding you to improve your coding
     * Reviews at your pace, making room for True Peer Review when
       necessary

   We are ready to help you in becoming a truly great programmer. Are you?

   Yes? Only one answer: [27]subscribe to the Beta!

   As a final – important – note: we have everything to thank [28]our
   Alpha testers for. They challenge us – day after day – to come up with
   the best Ruby Code Review we can deliver. Thank you all, it’s been –
   and still is – an exhilarating ride!

   We hope this post has tickled you to be the best you can be, we can
   only hope that PullReview will play a part in your journey!

       Code review mean you guys going to do unit testing of code ? If yes
       than you need programming in any standard level or just any kind of
       ROR code you can review and give feedback.

            Hi. We do not run your unit tests, we’re doing static analysis
            of the code. Some of our checks are specific to Rails, but not
            that much. We evaluate various kind of problems like style,
            security, code smells or even some design bad practices.

       That’s pretty cool continuous integration. I tend to also use a
       form of local continuous integration with guard, automatically
       running unit tests and linters when my code changes, before I even
       commit and push.
       [62]https://github.com/mcandre/rubycheck/blob/master/Guardfile
       This example runs Rake tasks, but could be easily modified to run
       Reek, Flay, and other Ruby code linters.

            Hi Andrew,
            This is a part of what we want to achieve: group tools and
            practices that we (as a community) know and like, and make
            them better together. I like as much as any developer to tweak
            my own settings, but at the end of the day, I want to spend my
            time delivering features and value – not installing tools.
            Having this kind of tools centralized also means that our
            whole (three persons) team use them the same way, and that no
            one forget to run them.

       I even use guard in nonRuby projects, switching out *.rb for *.js,
       and reek for jshint, for example.
