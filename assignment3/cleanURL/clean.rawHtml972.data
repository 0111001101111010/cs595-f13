   Vitamin D and Cancer Prevention

sunshine vitamin D Keeping your vitamin D levels optimized is vital in
fighting or preventing cancer and other diseases

   I love being in the sunshine. I lie on the beach as often as I can make
   time for it. I go outside most days, midday, for at least an hour
   during the summer. When I am talking to a friend on the street, I
   always make sure we are standing in the sunshine. I avoid sunscreen. (I
   work hard to never sunburn.) I go to warm, sunny places often and I
   have always had a voracious appetite for dairy products, including
   grass-fed, raw milk. I have also intermittently taken 4,000 to 5,000 IU
   of Vitamin D, or cholecalciferol.
   I have studied the importance of Vitamin D. I tell my clients to have
   their Vitamin D levels tested. When these levels are low, we add
   supplemental Vitamin D and retest until the levels are appropriate.
   However, until recently, I had never had my own Vitamin D level tested.
   I thought that it just wouldn't be possible for me to have low levels
   of Vitamin D.
   A month ago, I had my Vitamin D levels checked. I was shocked. My
   Vitamin D 25-OH or 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was a whopping 31. The doc
   told me this was just fine. The range they consider to be normal is
   between 20-100 ng/mL. Quite a range, wouldn't you say? However, I knew
   differently. The minimum healthy Vitamin D level is 50 ng/mL (see
   chart) and 50 is too low if you are fighting a disease like cancer or a
   chronic illness like fibromyalgia or Irritable Bowel Syndrome or if you
   simply want to reduce your risks of these health troubles.
   Did you know that cancer is now the number one killer in the United
   States? It is estimated that over half a million people in the United
   States alone will die of cancer this year. Yes, a healthy diet is a
   cornerstone of prevention. Yes, coffee enemas are an excellent
   preventative measure. Yes, optimizing your adrenal health is key. And
   the science is now clear that keeping your Vitamin D levels optimized
   is also a must to avoid cancer. Please, you, get your Vitamin D levels
   tested, and if they are low, take the appropriate supplements.
