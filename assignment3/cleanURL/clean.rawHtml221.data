Strategic Options

Algorithms + Derivatives = $$

   [1][so_website.png]

Anybody can make a website now a days...

But very few incorporate Algorithms...

   [2][trade.png]

Yes, [3]Algorithm. I have developed a proprietary algorithm to track over
1,000 stocks. Everyday after the market closes, the algorithm produces Buy &
Sell Signals. The stock above (GMCR, Green Mountain Coffee you had this
morning) returned over 220% after the algorithm produced a "buy" signal.

But the question you want to really ask, is not how did you do that? I know
your are just dying to ask if I use Object Oriented Programming. Of course, I
used OOP. How else would I be able make roughly a million calculations in 45
seconds? Other languages used, Linux script, PHP, PECL Stats, procedural
programming, crontab, Yahoo API, Google API, MySql, Relational Databases

Want a stock tip? I've got about 1,000.
