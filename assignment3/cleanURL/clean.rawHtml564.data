Get the Chic look with Sinatra’s Hats

[36]Home / [37]Fashion / [38]Accessories

George Harpa

31^st August 2013

   Sinatra is one of the finest American gentleman, singer, dancer, actor,
   director. Born in an Italian family, being spoiled and always dressed
   in vogue, he quickly got used with the good taste and elegance. He
   started his artistic career in 1935, gaining quickly popularity because
   of his charm, unique voice and style; every woman felt quickly in love
   with him. With his ups and downs in life he always knew how to stand up
   in his feet and to go on.

   One of the most particular clothing item that he succeeded easily to
   put in value and to create a particular style is the gentleman’s hat.
   He has definitely succeeded to remain a men’s fashion icon and also a
   lifestyle icon, even in these modern times.

   In any gentleman’s wardrobe an item of cloth must be always found and
   this is the hat. The hat was the element that defined any gentleman’s
   position in the society for many centuries. Sinatra adopted the hat in
   his lifestyle and he worn it in his style, inspiring many gentlemen.

   The essence of the Sinatra’s hats is defined by details, style and
   authenticity.

   Frank Sinatra had the opportunity of living in the in the golden age of
   the American hat industry, when every man leave the house with his head
   covered, even if he wasn’t comfortable until someone tells them that
   they look good. It was said that a man acted like the hat was simply an
   extension of him or he would be incomplete without it. That’s why,
   wearing hats it was a science, but an art form. So I give you a piece
   of advice: wear your hat with confidence and proud as Sinatra did it!
