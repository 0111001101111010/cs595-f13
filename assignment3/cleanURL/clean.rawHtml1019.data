   A serial port can simply be defined as “A port, or interface, that can
   be used for serial communication, in which only 1 bit is transmitted at
   a time.”  – Webopedia- [20]Serial Port

   Serial ports were once very popular until USBs and Firewires came
   along. Serial ports are still in use today especially in configuring
   devices like servers, routers and switches. This is because the serial
   ports do not depend much on software support from the connecting device
   (host). In modern personal computers and laptops, serial ports are
   becoming unpopular and are slowly disappearing.

   The term ‘serial port’ in telecommunications refers to a device
   compliant to RS-232 (Recommended Standard 232) and RS-232C or RS-422 in
   computers, although many manufactures have their own versions of serial
   ports.

   Examples of devices that use serial ports include serial mouse or
   keyboards, old printers and scanners, computer monitors and bar code
   scanners. In Windows, serial ports are known as COM ports
   (Communication ports) while on Unix-like operating systems they are
   referred to as TTY derived from the word ‘teletypewriter’.

   [21]How a Serial Port Works

   In most serial communications, there will be a DCE (Data Communications
   Equipment) and a DTE (Data Terminal Equipment) and both work using
   start and stop bits to send and receive information. In a scenario
   where there is need for parallel to serial communication, an UART
   (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is used to switch
   parallel to serial data. Most serial connectors on the market are the 9
   pin and 25 pin connectors with the 25 pin having 16 unused pins in most
   communications. This makes the 9 pin connector more popular.

   • Pin 5. Signal Ground

   • Pin 3. Receive Data         • Pin 8. Data Carrier Detect

   • Pin 4. Request to Send   • Pin 20. Data Terminal Ready

   • Pin 5. Clear to Send         • Pin 22. Ring Indicator

   • Pin 6. Data Set Ready

   Since serial connections are considered slow, they are not fit for high
   data transfers therefore replaced by USBs. They are also converters
   available to covert serial to USB, serial to parallel or serial to
   Ethernet and this helps in compatibility where one device has serial
   ports and the other does not.
