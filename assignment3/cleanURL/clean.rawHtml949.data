          Can traumatic brain injury impair a child's working memory?

   New Rochelle, NY, September 26, 2013Traumatic brain injury (TBI) during
   childhood can have long-term effects on cognitive and psychosocial
   functioning, including poor academic achievement. Pediatric TBI can
   cause significant deficits in working memory, as demonstrated in a
   study published in Journal of Neurotrauma, a peer-reviewed publication
   from Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers. The article is available free
   on the Journal of Neurotrauma website at
   [9]http://www.liebertpub.com/neu.

   Working memory is the ability to collect, retain, and use information
   needed to perform tasks and respond to immediate demands. Amery Treble
   and coauthors from University of Houston, Texas and University of Texas
   Health Science Center at Houston used brain imaging studies to measure
   verbal and visuospatial working memory in a group of children who
   sustained TBI and a control group who did not. The comparison showed
   poorer visuospatial working memory in the pediatric TBI group, which
   was associated with disruptions in brain connectivity between neural
   networks that underlie working memory.

   In the article "Working Memory and Corpus Callosum Microstructural
   Integrity after Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury: A Diffusion Tensor
   Tractography Study," the authors propose that the identification of
   neuroanatomical biomarkers indicative of these changes in brain
   microstructure might allow for early identification of children at
   increased risk for impaired working memory and for earlier
   intervention.

   "While confirming the longstanding belief that the corpus callosum is
   consistently involved with traumatic brain, this study's exquisite
   regionally specific analyses of callosal integrity, together with its
   evaluation of working memory in a pediatric brain-injured population,
   make this a particularly important contribution to the field of
   pediatric TBI," says John T. Povlishock, PhD, Editor-in-Chief of
   Journal of Neurotrauma and Professor, VCU Neuroscience Center, Medical
   College of Virginia, Richmond.

   About the Journal

   Journal of Neurotrauma is an authoritative peer-reviewed journal
   published 24 times per year in print and online that focuses on the
   latest advances in the clinical and laboratory investigation of
   traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. Emphasis is on the basic
   pathobiology of injury to the nervous system, and the papers and
   reviews evaluate preclinical and clinical trials targeted at improving
   the early management and long-term care and recovery of patients with
   traumatic brain injury. Journal of Neurotrauma is the official journal
   of the National Neurotrauma Society and the International Neurotrauma
   Society. Complete tables of content and a sample issue may be viewed on
   the Journal of Neurotrauma website at
