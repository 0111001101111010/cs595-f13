The Hacker’s Guide to getting Press

   Combining [13]Mechanical Turk with the [14]Google News API to get your
   startup national press coverage. No PR experience required.
   Warning: you only launch once. I do not recommend generating press
   until you’ve validated your customer segment(s), their pain(s), and
   much of your solution. Use this to spark a flame you’re sure will be an
   inferno.

Now, lets hack some press…

   Getting press is daunting for just about every founder. Who do you talk
   to? How do you find them? What do you pitch them? All questions I spend
   hours thinking about…for…every…project.

   But with a little creativity, and a little hacking, getting press is
   easier than I thought. Easy enough to get a recent product covered by…
   [16]mash [17]forbes [18]wired  [19] TNW  [20] Venturebeat3
   [21]logo-geekwire-final [22]gigaom-logo2

Background

   Some friends and I were launching [23]ThingsWeStart, a “Crowdfunding
   Aggregator” – imagine all of the projects on Kickstarter, Indiegogo,
   etc. displayed on a map, so you could support projects near you.

   Something this badass deserved a press push…

Step #1 – Find the Right Reporters

   The first step was to find reporters who might cover us. That started
   with a Google News [24]search for “Kickstarter”.
   Hypothesis: reporters who have already written about Kickstater, or a
   Kickstarter project, are more likely to write about a map of
   Kickstarter projects.

   This is a very different approach than listing all possible news
   outlets and submitting tips to them. Instead I was personally targeting
   individual reporters, who already demonstrated interest in our subject
   matter.

   Want to follow along? [25]Search Google News for articles related to
   your company’s value proposition.

Step #2 – Download their Articles

   Now I had some articles, but what I really needed was the reporters’
   contact info. Instead of searching through each story on my own, which
   would take forever, I wanted to created a spreadsheet of them so I
   could farm out the work of collecting each reporter contact info.

   Luckily, [26]Google News has an API which makes that relatively easy –
   but there’s no sense in you reinventing the wheel. Please, [27]use my
   code:
   [28]Google News Downloader Getting MVP Press Hack

   Click the pic, use the tool, and you’re halfway there!
   Following along? [29]Use this page to download a spreadsheet of
   articles by reporters you want to contact.

Step #3 – Collect their Contact Info

   With the list of articles in hand, I wanted to collect the names and
   email addresses of each reporter – so I could personally tell them
   about our launch.

   Thing is, I didn’t want to do that work myself – it’s boring. Instead,
   I asked the good folks on [30]Mechanical Turk (mTurk) to do it for
   me…for $.03 per email address! If you’re not familiar with mTurk, [31]I
   can’t recommend it enough.

   To get started, I [32]created a HIT template:

   mechanical turk template

   Then I [33]uploaded a CSV (the spreadsheet you downloaded in Step #2)
   to mTurk:

   …and mTurk automatically combined the two to create a HIT for each
   article in the CSV:

   mechanical turk template preview

   Rather than investing two weeks digging for contact info for 700
   articles, dozens of people delivered me results within a couple days.
   I also recommend including tips for finding author’s emails addresses
   in your HITs. [34]Example

   Following along? Create a [35]new HIT on mTurk and [36]use this HTML as
   the basis for your template.

Step #4 – Progress Monitoring

   When I did this, I saw a large number of HITs completed within the
   first few days. After that, results started to drop off.  I think my
   HITs eventually got pushed to the bottom of the stack.
   Pssst: If you like this post, consider subscribing for more just like
   it: [37]email or [38]RSS

   To counter that, every couple days I would cancel my incomplete HITs,
   and relaunch any articles I didn’t have contact information for.

   Within a week, I had contact information for 350 reporters who had
   written articles about Kickstarter.

Step #5 – Build a Press Kit

   The most important rule I’ve found when working with reporters is:
   The more you help reporters, the more they’ll help you.
   [39]tweet-this-button

   These poor folks are under crazy deadlines, have to produce multiple
   stories per day, and are inundated with requests for coverage.  The
   more we can help them out by writing our story for them, the better of
   we’ll both be. Win-win.

   Here’s the [40]press kit we prepared for our launch.  It includes:
     * Description of the problem we solve
     * Screenshots
     * [41]Beautiful Infographics by [42]Stephanie Haller (be sure to
       include some kind of image)
     * Bio of the team
     * Why we’re doing this
     * Why we’re different than existing solutions

Step #6 – Prime the Pump

   With contact information in hand, and a killer press kit, it was time
   to reach out to the reporters. 5 days before launch, I gave them a
   heads up we were coming, but no access to our press kit:
   Example: [43]5 days to launch email

   A couple days later, I gave them access to our full press kit, but told
   them not to write about us until launch day:
   Example: [44]3 days to launch email

   On launch day, I told them to have at it:
   Example: [45]Launch day emai

   Important: embargoes are essential.

   It’s important to tell reporters that your content is “embargoed” until
   you officially launch, which means they’re not allowed to write about
   you until your launch date.  If you don’t mention this, one of these
   folks is going to jump the gun and publish your story early. That in
   turn, will make other reporters less interested in covering you, since
   it’ll be old news by then.

   We didn’t include an embargo, but we should have…

   Some news outlets/reporters [46]hate embargoes. If you really want
   their press, only tell them about your launch the day before you go
   live.

Step #7 – Watch the Ink Roll In!

   Once we launched we simply setup some [47]Google Alerts and Twitter
   searches, and watched the [48]press roll in.

Hack Metrics

     * Hours spent: 40 (includes time coming up with the hack, writing the
       code, etc. Should take you less.)
     * Money spent: 350 email addresses x $0.03/address = $10.50
     * PR pros hired: 0
     * Total write-ups: [49]13
     * Traffic generated: ??? Remember when GoDaddy’s DNS service went
       down? That was the [50]day we launched :)

   Following along? I’d love to hear if you’ve tried this, or other press
   hacks!

Final Tips:

     * Play around with pricing. If you’re in a hurry, you’ll probably
       want to pay more than $.03/article
     * Block turkers who submit obviously fraudulent contact info (you
       won’t have to pay for those)

TL; DR

   The Google News API and Mechanical Turk can be combined to get
   [51]lots of press for your launch.

       I love the idea of using coding skills to bypass the traditional PR
       tactics.

       Love the Hack.
       Note, it is a gift that keeps on giving — not just for launch day.
       Key ingredient for sustainment is having your company/app produce
       data and insights that reporters could use.
       My Example: [80]http://www.brandinsights.com/ (we score a top press
       hit every week).
       Justin, in your case the commentary on kickstarter trends can serve
       that same type of info (you could do industry by industry, tech
       trends, movie trends, cooking appliance trends, etc. etc.)

            Interesting idea, but we ultimately shut the Kickstarter
            project down. We didn’t have enough interest from customers to
            turn it into something sustainable. I’ve found press helpful
            in very specific scenarios, and I love the idea of sustainably
            generated press, but we weren’t solving a big enough pain for
            it to matter.

       Thanks JustinWi! This is outstanding. Funny, I read this shortly
       after the Forbes article on ‘Why Most Startups Don’t ‘Get’ Press’.
       Most = ones that do not read this post.

       Awesome write up, thanks for sharing! Curious, what email client
       did you use to blast out the emails? Did you run into any trouble
       w/ spam filters?
       [92]Reply
          + [93]September 30, 2013 - 10:57 am [94]Justin Wilcox
            Thanks! We used Mailchimp and we tried to make the emails look
            personally written by mentioning by name (and link) the
            article that got us to that author. That said, we had an
            unsubscribe link in the form of “Don’t ever want to hear about
            ThingsWeStart again?”
            No data on whether or not the messages landed in the SPAM
            bucket, but considering the interest we got, my gut says it
            wasn’t too big of a problem.
