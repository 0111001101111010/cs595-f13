   Finance MBA LDP Overview:
   The Finance MBA Leadership Development Program (MBA LDP) is a two-year
   program that prepares recent MBA graduates to be ready for promotion to
   manager upon completion of the program within the finance division at
   Johnson & Johnson. The MBA LDP program successfully develops a pipeline
   of future leaders (Directors and above) for Johnson & Johnson through a
   combination of diverse rotational assignments, targeted training, and
   continual coaching and development.
   Location of Finance Positions:
   Positions may be available at various Johnson & Johnson operating
   companies located in or near Central New Jersey; Philadelphia, PA;
   Jacksonville, Florida; Cincinnati, OH; Raynham, MA, Los Angeles and San
   Francisco, California.
   Rotations & Assignments:
   Participants gain invaluable on-the-job experiences during two
   rotations within one of Johnson & Johnson business segments, working in
   different functional areas (financial reporting, sales and marketing
   finance, operations finance, research & development finance, licensing
   and acquisition analysis, etc). These assignments are designed to
   develop a strong foundation of business acumen, technical skills and
   J&J knowledge upon which the participant can be successful at the
   manager level and beyond. Rotations range across both the accounting
   and finance disciplines.
   Training/Professional Development:
   First year participants attend an orientation to learn more about the
   available resources to help you in your job. The participants attend
   the MBA LDP Summit, which provides the opportunity to gain exposure to
   J&J's senior finance leadership and learn more about the Credo and
   Global Leadership Profile. Additionally, in the first year of the
   program, participants are encouraged to complete 40 hours of classroom
   and e-learning training that is tailored to the individual's needs. In
   the second year, participants are enrolled in a First Line Manager
   program, which combines e learning and classroom training. Candidates
   are also strongly encouraged to pursue a professional certification
   (CMA or CPA).
   Coaching & Development:
   In addition to regular coaching and development from their supervisor,
   MBA LDP participants are assigned a mentor to help guide them to be
   successful in the program.
   As part of a leadership program, participants must demonstrate the
   potential to be ready for promotion to the manager level upon
   completion of the program in order to successfully complete the
   program.
