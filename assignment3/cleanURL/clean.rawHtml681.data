ActsAsParanoid

   A simple plugin which hides records instead of deleting them, being
   able to recover them.

   This branch targets Rails 3.2. If you're working with another version,
   switch to the corresponding branch.

Credits

   This plugin was inspired by [65]acts_as_paranoid and
   [66]acts_as_active.

   While porting it to Rails 3, I decided to apply the ideas behind those
   plugins to an unified solution while removing a lot of the complexity
   found in them. I eventually ended up writing a new plugin from scratch.

Usage

   You can enable ActsAsParanoid like this:
class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_paranoid
end

Options

   You can also specify the name of the column to store it's deletion and
   the type of data it holds:
     * :column => 'deleted_at'
     * :column_type => 'time'

   The values shown are the defaults. While column can be anything (as
   long as it exists in your database), type is restricted to:
     * boolean
     * time or
     * string

   If your column type is a string, you can also specify which value to
   use when marking an object as deleted by passing :deleted_value
   (default is "deleted"). Any records with a non-matching value in this
   column will be treated normally (ie: not deleted).

Filtering

   If a record is deleted by ActsAsParanoid, it won't be retrieved when
   accessing the database. So, Paranoiac.all will not include the
   deleted_records. if you want to access them, you have 2 choices:
Paranoiac.only_deleted # retrieves the deleted records
Paranoiac.with_deleted # retrieves all records, deleted or not

   When using the default column_type of 'time', the following extra
   scopes are provided:
time = Time.now

Paranoiac.deleted_after_time(time)
Paranoiac.deleted_before_time(time)

# Or roll it all up and get a nice window:
Paranoiac.deleted_inside_time_window(time, 2.minutes)

Real deletion

   In order to really delete a record, just use:
paranoiac.destroy!
Paranoiac.delete_all!(conditions)

   You can also permanently delete a record by calling destroy or
   delete_all on it twice. If a record was already deleted (hidden by
   ActsAsParanoid) and you delete it again, it will be removed from the
   database. Take this example:
p = Paranoiac.first
p.destroy # does NOT delete the first record, just hides it
Paranoiac.only_deleted.where(:id => p.id).destroy # deletes the first record fro
m the database

Recovery

   Recovery is easy. Just invoke recover on it, like this:
Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover

   All associations marked as :dependent => :destroy are also recursively
   recovered. If you would like to disable this behavior, you can call
   recover with the recursive option:
Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover(:recursiv
e => false)

   If you would like to change this default behavior for one model, you
   can use the recover_dependent_associations option
class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_paranoid :recover_dependent_associations => false
end

   By default, dependent records will be recovered if they were deleted
   within 2 minutes of the object upon which they depend. This restores
   the objects to the state before the recursive deletion without
   restoring other objects that were deleted earlier. The behavior is only
   available when both parent and dependant are using timestamp fields to
   mark deletion, which is the default behavior. This window can be
   changed with the dependent_recovery_window option:
class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_paranoid
    has_many :paranoids, :dependent => :destroy
end

class Paranoid < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :paranoic

    # Paranoid objects will be recovered alongside Paranoic objects
    # if they were deleted within 10 minutes of the Paranoic object
    acts_as_paranoid :dependent_recovery_window => 10.minutes
end

   or in the recover statement
Paranoiac.only_deleted.where("name = ?", "not dead yet").first.recover(:recovery
_window => 30.seconds)

Validation

   ActiveRecord's built-in uniqueness validation does not account for
   records deleted by ActsAsParanoid. If you want to check for uniqueness
   among non-deleted records only, use the macro validates_as_paranoid in
   your model. Then, instead of using validates_uniqueness_of, use
   validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted. This will keep deleted records
   from counting against the uniqueness check.
class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_paranoid
    validates_as_paranoid
    validates_uniqueness_of_without_deleted :name
end

p1 = Paranoiac.create(:name => 'foo')
p1.destroy

p2 = Paranoiac.new(:name => 'foo')
p2.valid? #=> true
p2.save

p1.recover #=> fails validation!

Status

   You can check the status of your paranoid objects with the deleted?
   helper
Paranoiac.create(:name => 'foo').destroy
Paranoiac.with_deleted.first.deleted? #=> true

Scopes

   As you've probably guessed, with_deleted and only_deleted are scopes.
   You can, however, chain them freely with other scopes you might have.
   This
Paranoiac.pretty.with_deleted

   is exactly the same as
Paranoiac.with_deleted.pretty

   You can work freely with scopes and it will just work:
class Paranoiac < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_paranoid
    scope :pretty, where(:pretty => true)
end

Paranoiac.create(:pretty => true)

Paranoiac.pretty.count #=> 1
Paranoiac.only_deleted.count #=> 0
Paranoiac.pretty.only_deleted.count #=> 0

Paranoiac.first.destroy

Paranoiac.pretty.count #=> 0
Paranoiac.only_deleted.count #=> 1
Paranoiac.pretty.only_deleted.count #=> 1

Associations

   Associations are also supported. From the simplest behaviors you'd
   expect to more nifty things like the ones mentioned previously or the
   usage of the :with_deleted option with belongs_to
class Parent < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :children, :class_name => "ParanoiacChild"
end

class ParanoiacChild < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :parent
  belongs_to :parent_including_deleted, :class_name => "Parent", :with_deleted =
> true
  # You cannot name association *_with_deleted
end

parent = Parent.first
child = parent.children.create
parent.destroy

child.parent #=> nil
child.parent_including_deleted #=> Parent (it works!)

Caveats

   Watch out for these caveats:
     * You cannot use scopes named with_deleted and only_deleted
     * You cannot use scopes named deleted_inside_time_window,
       deleted_before_time, deleted_after_time if your paranoid column's
       type is time
     * You cannot name association *_with_deleted
     * unscoped will return all records, deleted or not

Support

   This gem supports the most recent versions of Rails and Ruby.

Rails

   For Rails 3.2 check the README at the [67]rails3.2 branch and add this
   to your Gemfile:
gem "acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.4.0"

   For Rails 3.1 check the README at the [68]rails3.1 branch and add this
   to your Gemfile:
gem "rails3_acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.1.4"

   For Rails 3.0 check the README at the [69]rails3.0 branch and add this
   to your Gemfile:
gem "rails3_acts_as_paranoid", "~>0.0.9"

Ruby

   This gem is tested on Ruby 1.9, JRuby and Rubinius (both in 1.9 mode).
   It might work fine in 1.8, but it's not officially supported.
