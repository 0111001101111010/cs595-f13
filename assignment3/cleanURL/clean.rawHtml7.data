   pybotwar is a fun and educational game where players write computer
   programs to control simulated robots.

INTRODUCTION

   Your task is to create a computer program to control a robot for the
   arena. The last robot alive is the winner.

   Robot programs run in separate processes from the main simulation, and
   communicate with the main program over standard input and standard
   output channels. Theoretically, this means that the robots could be
   limited in the amount of system access they have, and how much of the
   system's resources they can consume.

   CAUTION! Right now, that is not the case. Robot programs run as regular
   Python programs, using the regular Python interpreter, and can do
   anything any other program can do.

   In the future, I intend to implement some kind of sandboxing for robot
   programs, but that is not done.
