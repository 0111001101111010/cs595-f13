[17]How to Add SASS Support in Sublime Text

   [18]Sublime Handles SASS

   [19]SASS, short for Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is a massively
   popular tool for web developers that takes a lot of the pain out of
   writing CSS. Unfortunately, Sublime doesn’t provide a lot of help if
   you want to use SASS in your project.

   Package Control lists a number of seemingly useful plugins, but each
   provides just one or two SASS features–none of them gives you
   everything you need to use SASS effectively. Then there’s the whole
   compiling thing–messing with a separate command line tool every time
   you want to make a CSS tweak is a royal pain.

   Here’s the setup I use that makes working with SASS as seamless as
   using plain old CSS.

Install SASS

   Since this isn’t a SASS 101 tutorial, I’m going to assume that you’ve
   already installed SASS and know how to use the command line compiler.
   If not, here’s a [20]good walkthrough.

   I’m also assuming that you have Package Control set up in Sublime. If
   you haven’t encountered it yet, Package Control lets you install
   hundreds of plugins with just a few keystrokes—without leaving Sublime.
   The [21]Package Control site includes setup instructions.

Configure Syntax Highlighting

   The first time you open a sass or scss file, Sublime just shrugs its
   shoulders and treats it like plain text, rendering your meticulously
   formatted style rules in monotonous black and white.

   Package Control lists a handful of plugins that add syntax highlighting
   for SASS. The runaway favorite is the [22]sass-textmate-bundle plugin,
   called simply Sass in Package Control.

   After you install the Sass plugin, when you open a scss file you’re
   greeted with beautifully highlighted code:

   But don’t celebrate yet–if you open a sass file, you’ll find it’s still
   devoid of color. What gives?

   If you look in the lower right-hand corner of the screen, you’ll see a
   clue:

   As it turns out, a line in the Data/Packages/Rails/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage
   file is hijacking the sass extension and incorrectly setting the syntax
   to Ruby Haml instead of Sass.

   I’ve seen “fixes” for this problem that involve editing the Ruby
   Haml.tmLanguage file itself, or one of the files in the SASS plugin.
   That’s a bad idea because future updates to either of those packages
   will overwrite your customization, and you’ll be back where you
   started.

   Fortunately, the simplest fix is also the best: Sublime allows you to
   specify what syntax to use for a given file extension.

   To force Sublime to correctly highlight sass files:
   1. Open a sass file.
   2. Click View | Syntax | Open all with current extension as … | Sass.

Compiling from Sublime

   Messing with the command line SASS compiler is a bit of a hassle–and
   it’s unnecessary. With help from a couple of plugins, you can configure
   Sublime to automatically compile your SASS stylesheets every time you
   save a change.

   Sublime’s build system feature allows you to create custom build tasks
   and associate them with specific file types. You can do this by hand in
   your sublime-project file, or you can let the [23]SASS Build plugin
   handle the heavy lifting for you.

   Installing the SASS Build plugin creates two new entries under Tools |
   Build: Sass and Sass – Compressed.

   Compiling your SASS files with this plugin is simple. While editing a
   sass or scss file, just hit Ctrl+B on Windows or Linux or Command+B on
   OS X.

   By default, Sublime will use the regular Sass build option, which
   compiles your SASS and formats the CSS output for easy readability.

   To create minified CSS files for production, change the build option by
   clicking Tools | Build | Sass – Compressed.

Automating Builds

   Building your SASS files straight from Sublime is convenient, but at
   some point you’re going to spend 30 minutes debugging a crazy stubborn
   CSS issue only to realize that you actually fixed it 25 minutes ago and
   just forgot to recompile the scss file. Not that I’m bitter or
   anything.

   You can avoid this by installing the [24]SublimeOnSaveBuild plugin,
   which will automatically execute the default build action whenever you
   save changes to a file. (It’s also handy when you’re working with
   CoffeeScript.)

   SublimeOnSaveBuild supports a filename filter, and by default it’s only
   configured to run for css, js, sass, less and scss files.

       hey Josh!
       Thanks for this post! I have been looking for a better way to
       develop with sass locally. In rails all this is setup for you
       automatically, but I havent seemed to find a ton of help out there
       for using sass on other projects, like wordpress, or just a quick
       static page.
       thanks for the share!

       Great post, thanks a ton. On Sublime Text 3, just git clone the
       SASS Build plugin repo and you will need to clone the sublime tree
       from sass-textmate-bundle plugin dump them into (Mac OSX)
       ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/

       I have a problem when compiling the code:
       The console of Sublime Text says:
       [Errno 2] No such file or directory
       [cmd: [u'sass', u'--update',
       u'/Users/alex/Desktop/Project/assets/styles/builtins.scss
       :/Users/alex/Desktop/Project/assets/styles/builtins.css',
       u'--stop-on-error', u'--no-cache', u'--style', u'compressed']]
       [dir: /Users/alex/Desktop/Project/assets/styles]
       [path: /usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin]
       [Finished]
       And no file is being compiled to css. What can I do to solve this
       problem?

       I’m newish to the webdev game (tho an old hand in coding), and
       recently was introduced to Codekit. I’ve used and loved Sublime for
       a while. Does this workflow largely obviate Codekit, in terms of
       its benefits for working with SASS? Codekit looks great but I feel
       like Sublime should be able to do most of what Codekit does, via
       plugins.

       Thanks for the fix for Ruby Haml getting in the way of Sass
       highlighting. I never knew that Sublime Text feature existed. If
       this were on Stack Overflow you’d have my upvote.

       Thanks a bunch. With your instructions I’ve got my first attempt at
       a sass tutorial up and running.
       Have run into a major snag, however, and I’m inexperieinced enough
       not to be able to figure out the source of my problem. Perhaps you
       could provide a solution…
       The tutorial requests that “@import “compass”; be placed at the top
       of the other import statements. Sublime returns the following
       error… “Sass::SyntaxError: File to import not found or unreadable:
       compass.”
       Obviously, Sublime is not finding compass. How to remedy this?
       When I comment-out this import statement the rest of the imports
       load and the project compiles as expected.
       I’m totally confused. Any insights?

       SASS package isn’t showing up in package control. Maybe it’s
       because I already installed a package with that exact name or it
       changed?
       I am also not seeing an additional option to colour as scss.
       So what’s the deal?

       Switching to ST3 and couldn’t remember the name of the syntax
       package so thanks for writing this up.
       However, Josh, a minor point; it’s actually ‘Sass’ and not ‘SASS’.
