Gumby electronics: Stretchable screens pull closer to reality

   By [41]Mark Halper | September 25, 2013, 4:12 AM PDT

   Engineering drawing for the flexible screen? In the near future, your
   gadget could twist and bend, a bit like this contortionist.

   –

   Bend me, shape me, any way you want me.

   Those are the lyrics to an old pop tune, and they also describe the
   future of electronics, lighting, fashion and architecture as scientists
   develop pliant displays that do everything from emitting light to
   serving as screens for TVs, computers and smart gadgets like phones and
   watches.

   The idea has been a long time coming, delayed by among other things,
   manufacturing challenges.

   But it just drew a little closer, as researchers at the University of
   California Los Angeles (UCLA) said they have stretched an OLED (organic
   light emitting diode) material 1,000 times to 30 percent beyond its
   normal size, and the material still works, [42]The Engineer reported.
   Gives new meaning to the old ad slogan takes a licking and keeps on
   ticking.

   “Researchers at UCLA have developed a transparent, elastic organic
   light-emitting device that can be repeatedly stretched, folded and
   twisted at room temperature whilst remaining lit,” The Engineer wrote
   (the website is British, so it uses words like “whilst”) in summarizing
   a paper published in Nature Photonics.

   When manufacturers finally perfect the technology, look out for a brave
   new world of foldable phones and gadgets, luminescent furniture and
   fashion, glowing wallpaper, and curvy radiant buildings.

   Its true arrival is still a few years away, [43]according to research
   firm IHS, although Samsung now says that it will introduce a [44]curved
   screen phone next month.

   Curved is one thing, foldable is another. The rollable screen is still
   somewhere just around the bend.
