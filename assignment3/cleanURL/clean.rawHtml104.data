       About Being a Senior Site Reliability Engineer
       The Senior Site Reliability Engineer will take a key role on the
       SRE team, which is responsible for ensuring high site availability,
       service reliability and optimal service performance. Our team is
       responsible for almost every service offered, involving some of the
       largest deployments of cutting-edge technologies in the world.
       Through small teams based in Palo Alto, California and Bangalore,
       India, and London, UK, the SRE team provides 24/7 oversight and
       support of the infrastructure and services that power the Apigee
       platform service.
       The Senior Site Reliability Engineer must be able to work
       independently and multi-task among several concurrent problems,
       perform triage and prioritization as necessary through the exercise
       of discretion and independent judgment including marshaling the
       appropriate and necessary internal resources during high-pressure
       situations. The Senior Site Reliability Engineer has a strong sense
       of responsibility and problem ownership and is committed to driving
       issues to completion; the Sr. SRE adapts quickly and is capable of
       compiling together working solutions across a broad technology
       stack and working with engineering teams on long-term fixes.
       The Senior Site Reliability Engineer will:
       - Ramp up quickly and demonstrate ownership and accountability of
       Site Availability and Service Reliability
       - Analyze product performance and reliability, proposing and
       driving enhancements and improvements
       - Provide technical leadership across all of Apigee’s production
       properties and SRE core competencies
       - Effectively balance tactical and strategic deliverables amidst
       changing priorities in a fast paced environment
       - Actively drive technical RCA and root cause resolution to
       preserve and improve availability
       - Collaborate with fellow SREs and other teams to investigate and
       resolve complex problems
       - Be responsible for daily management and oversight of SRE work
       queues to SLA
       - Have a strong commitment to all aspects of documentation
       - Own automation and tooling for systems management to support the
       SRE charter
       - Communicate effectively to achieve quick diagnosis, resolution or
       effective handover of issues for progressive troubleshooting
       - Perform periodic on-call duty as part of a global team
       maintaining the availability and performance of the Apigee site and
       APIs used by third-party services, as well as the various internal
       services and systems on which these core interfaces depend
       - Handle ambiguous situations effectively
