   Parliament hacker court case postponed

   The court case of a Capetonian woman accused of hacking the local
   parliament’s internet has been postponed after she appeared in court
   yesterday (Wednesday).

   Alleged hacker Cleopatra Mosana was questioned on 33 cases of
   legislation violation related to internet communications in the
   Bellville Specialised Commercial Crime Court in Cape Town.

   However, prosecutor Juan Agulhas revealed plans for the withdrawal of
   charges to her court lawyer, Greg Duncan, the [23]South African Press
   Association reports.

   The case is now postponed until November 15, with Duncan expecting
   Mosana to be excused since she is now residing in Centurion, Gauteng.

   The magistrate has however issued a warrant of arrest if she fails to
   appear.

   Mosana is to face accusations of hacking incidents between April and
   June 2011 with regards to the internet system Tango Lamani, which
   contained highly confidential information.

   Lamani was made aware of the hackings by the parliament’s IT
   department, which tracked the computer of offence to the department of
   home affairs, where Mosana was previously employed.
