Map of Galactic Clouds Where Stars Are Born Takes Shape

   Sep. 11, 2013  A UNSW-led team of astronomers has begun to map the
   location of the most massive and mysterious objects in our galaxy --
   the giant gas clouds where new stars are born.

   Using a telescope at Coonabarabran that narrowly escaped devastation in
   a recent bushfire, the team identifies the galactic clouds of molecular
   gas -- which can be up to 100 light years across -- from the carbon
   monoxide they contain.

   "On Earth, carbon monoxide is poisonous -- a silent killer. But in
   space, it is the second most abundant molecule and the easiest to see,"
   says Professor Michael Burton, of the UNSW School of Physics, who leads
   the team.

   "One of the largest unresolved mysteries in galactic astronomy is how
   these giant, diffuse clouds form in the interstellar medium. This
   process plays a key role in the cosmic cycle of birth and death of
   stars."

   A research paper on the first stage of the work -- covering a region of
   the sky about the size of four full moons -- is published in the
   journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia.

   The carbon monoxide survey of the Southern Milky Way is being carried
   out with the 22 metre Mopra millimetre wave telescope at Coonabarabran.
   While the adjoining workshop, office, and accommodation wing were
   destroyed in the bushfire in January, the telescope's control room
   survived because it was encased in brick.

   The international team is also searching for "dark" galactic gas clouds
   -- unseen clouds that contain very little carbon monoxide. It is
   assumed these clouds are mostly made up of molecular hydrogen which is
   too cold to detect.

   The team is using telescopes in Antarctica and Chile to search for
   these dark clouds, based on the presence of carbon atoms, rather than
   carbon molecules, in the clouds.

   "Taken together, these three surveys will provide us with a picture of
   the distribution and movement of gas clouds in our galaxy," says
   Professor Burton.

   Dark clouds, if found, could also be the "missing" source of gamma
   rays, which are produced when high-energy cosmic rays interact with the
   nuclei of gas atoms or molecules they encounter when travelling through
   space.

   "The source of more than 30 per cent of gamma rays remains unidentified
   -- another big mystery our research could throw light on," says
   Professor Burton.

   Some of the options for how large giant molecular clouds form include
   the gravitational collapse of an ensemble of small clouds into a larger
   one, or the random collision of small clouds which then agglomerate.

   About one star per year, on average, is formed in the Milky Way. Stars
   that explode and die then replenish the gas clouds, as well as moving
   the gas about and mixing it up.
