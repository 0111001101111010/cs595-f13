   Featured Meetup

NewHaven.io - Python Data Science

     * 5 days ago · 6:00 PM
     * [14]Prometheus Research

   Do you like your data big, medium, or small? Doesn't matter: this is
   the meetup for you. Let's have a series of short talks on whatever
   tools people want to show off. Decent ideas include numpy, scipy,
   pandas, statsmodels, scikit-learn, pymc, theano, ipython notebook,
   networkx, matplotlib, bokeh, nltk, gensim, disco, python-hadoop-stuff,
   whatever.

   (Please indicate in the comments on Meetup if you're willing to give a
   10m talk! We'll find a venue soon.)

   Beer and pizza.

       Just to verify, is it 5 minutes talk followed by a 5 min Q&A or 10
       minute talk followed by Q&A?
       Andy & Charles, as they may have mentioned, from Prometheus
       Research will be presenting as well, on HTSQL and HTRAF :)

            There is street parking usually available on crown closer to
            MISO or Crown 116. There is also a little lot behind the
            building, lot across from crown 116. There's also Crown St
            garage 2 blocks away.. right across from Karaoke Heros/Mochi
            store.

   [101]New Haven IO is an aggregator for all hacker-related stuff going
   on in New Haven, CT. Lots of us use Ruby, and lots of us use
   JavaScript, but there's mobile too, and Python, and Processing.

   We’re starting the next big phase for the New Haven tech scene, and
   could use your help. If you’re interested in programming, the
   intertubes, and whatnot, please get in touch. We started a [102]Google
   Group and are on Twitter at [103]@newhavenio.

   If you want to help us build the website, please start contributing
   to [104]our repo on GitHub.
