Talking Points on Canadian Commodity Distribution Networks

   09/18/2013 by Alex Carrick

   Canada’s economy benefits from resource wealth of a sufficient quantity
   not only to serve our own domestic needs, but to supply foreign markets
   as well. But there are interesting wrinkles in terms of getting the
   product to buyers and they have to do with distribution systems.

   Overland, most commodities are easily and cheaply moved by truck or
   rail. Electric power, oil and natural gas are the exceptions. The
   former is best sent by cable and the latter by pipelines.

   For seagoing transit, the temperature of natural gas is lowered to -160
   degrees celsius (-260 degrees Fahrenheit), which turns it into a fluid
   known as liquefied natural gas (LNG).

   Premier Christy Clark of B.C. is hoping to establish a major LNG
   export-industry in the northwest of her province. The region’s cold
   climate will significantly lower the cost of gas-to-liquid conversion
   versus competing proposals in Australia, Qatar and the southern U.S.

   As for oil, there are at least five major pipeline proposals under
   discussion in Canada at this time.

   Two are to the West Coast – Enbridge’s Northern Gateway and Kinder
   Morgan’s TransMountain line; one heads south to the Gulf of Mexico,
   TransCanada’s Keystone XL extension; and the final two make a bee-line
   to the East Coast, the reversal of Enbridge’s Line 9 and TransCanada’s
   Energy East visionary idea.

   Why such a flurry? The majority of Canada’s oil reserves are buried in
   land-locked Alberta. Producers do not have ready access to non-U.S.
   markets. The province accounts for two-thirds of Canada’s energy
   exports. Saskatchewan, with 12% of total exports, is similarly
   handicapped.

   Newfoundland’s energy sector, of course, is positioned on the sea, but
   its size ‒ 10% of the nation’s total energy exports ‒ is far eclipsed
   by Alberta.

   It’s also worth noting that the country’s largest refinery in Saint
   John, N.B. is currently set up to accept imports rather than to send
   product outward into the world.

   Western Canadian producers are often asked to accept less than the
   going rate for their crude.

   When storage facilities at Cushing, Oklahoma’s transportation hub are
   full to overflowing, the price offered to Canadian producers is well
   below the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark.

   Such a scenario is likely to become more frequent in the future as the
   U.S. increases its reserves by means of hydraulic fracturing (i.e.,
   “fracking”) of shale rock. This is causing an oil and natural gas boom
   in places such as North Dakota, Texas and many parts of the West.

   The new American energy boom suggests a diminishing reliance on outside
   sources heading towards 2020 and beyond. Analysts suggest this will
   lead to less involvement in the affairs of the Middle East. While it
   may seem hard to credit – matters are plenty “up in the air” as they
   are – there is a good chance this might destabilize the region even
   further.

   Current goings-on in the Arab world that are making nearly everyone
   uncomfortable include: the brutally vicious civil war in Syria; the
   behind-the-scenes involvement of al-Qaeda; Iran’s push for nuclear
   armament; suicide bombings intended to create anarchy in Iraq; and the
   ongoing Israeli-Palestinian stalemate, with Hezbollah and Hamas
   role-playing never far away.

   The potential for an even more volatile Middle East should be reason
   enough for Canada to firm up its own domestic energy logistics. As for
   what it would mean for national unity and pride, any tailor or cobbler
   knows the value of good stitching.

   Historically, the U.S. has become entangled in Middle Eastern affairs
   due to its vital national interest in maintaining oil supplies from the
   region.

   While a more energy-independent future is in the offing, America is not
   yet at that stage.

   The U.S. has lately become mired in the fetid swamp that is the Syrian
   revolution. President Obama first delineated a line in the sand (now
   referred to as “a red line”) concerning the use of chemical weaponry by
   the Assad government that, if crossed, would absolutely lead to U.S.
   military intervention, as both punishment and a warning not to continue
   down such a path.
   Now he’s changed his wording, claiming that the “red line” is the
   world’s moral check point.

   He’s leaving it up to Congress to decide whether the U.S. should launch
   an across-the-bows missile strike.  Elected officials are acutely aware
   of the public’s weariness with war and a majority of them appear
   reluctant to vote “yes”.

   The “out” for the President has been a “swiss cheese” (i.e.,
   full-of-holes) solution offered by President Putin of Russia. It has
   the supposed merit of adopting a diplomatic approach.

   Syria will sign an international accord banning the use of chemical
   weapons and it will dismantle its stockpile under the watchful eye of
   an independent monitoring agency.

   But there are several “catches”. This process will take place in the
   middle of a civil war, with fighting all around. And Mr. Putin
   continues to promote the otherwise discredited notion that it has been
   the rebels who have been using sarin gas, not the regime in Damascus.

   Few experts believe the process of “decommissioning” will go either
   smoothly or thoroughly.

   The problems the U.S. is having with Syria lead me to wonder if maybe
   President Obama is rethinking his stand on TransCanada’s Keystone XL
   pipeline. If not, he should be.

   An integrated and fully secure North American oil market would look
   pretty good right now.

   Consider how much greater flexibility the President would have if the
   U.S. was a giant step closer to North American energy security.

   Canada, with its stable government and value system closely aligned
   with its neighbor to the south, can supply that assurance.

   Some celebrities have opted to speak against further development of
   Alberta’s Oil Sands. Robert Redford and Neil Young are apparently
   advocating that North Americans adopt a Cadillac (i.e., in terms of the
   lost-opportunity cost) environmental policy. What would serve us better
   would be a more practical and streamlined Cruze version.

   The Canadian East Coast pipeline proposals have come to the fore
   because the roadblocks standing in the way of pipelines to the West
   Coast – in the form of a well-established and deeply entrenched “green”
   lobby, as well as aboriginal opposition – are formidable.

   Reversal of Line 9 would change the flow along an existing oil pipeline
   from refineries in Quebec City to customers in Ontario. But after the
   switch-around, reaching a port on the St. Lawrence would still come up
   short. Quebec is not an all-weather harbor.

   The Energy East project solves this problem. It would take the oil one
   step further, to Saint John, N.B. That deep-water port can accommodate
   super tankers year round.

   Both the mayor of Saint John and the premier of New Brunswick are
   solidly behind Energy East. They crave the potential boost in
   construction employment short-term and the additional opportunities
   longer-term.

   As part of the overall project, Irving Oil will build a $300 million
   shipping terminal at its Canaport facility. A couple of years ago, the
   company was considering construction of a second refinery at the site.
   It has since decided that might be something for a later date.

   Energy East will make use of TransCanada’s existing pipeline assets
   from Alberta to Ontario. New pipe will have to be laid to Quebec City
   and on to Saint John. Opposition from anti-development academics and
   social advocates is likely to be heated and vociferous.

   The minority-governing and separatist-leaning Parti Quebecois in the
   province has been pretty tight-lipped concerning its opinion of the
   project. Surely it’s weighing two opposing points of view.

   Firming up a secure supply of oil from Alberta should only be good
   business for the two refineries in Quebec City. On the opposite side of
   the teeter-totter is the GHG-busting crowd which provides a core
   portion of the PQ’s grass-roots support.

   This faction has already put an end to natural gas development in the
   province that would make use of new fracking technology.

   Another idea being floated is to ship oil by rail to Churchill,
   Manitoba on the coastline of Hudson’s Bay. This is currently a
   well-used route for grain shipments.

   The harbor is frozen over in winter and is only open from July to
   late-October each year. Global warming and icebreakers might manage to
   keep the “window” open longer.

   The expanded use of railways, barges and ships to move oil carries its
   own inherent problems, as was clearly demonstrated in the Lac Mégantic
   derailment. Property damage was extensive, but it was the cost in human
   lives that was truly tragic.

   At a minimum, hearings into that accident will lead to greater
   regulations to ensure safety along railroad shipping lines. Insurance
   firms have already raised their premiums.

   There is a final question to consider as well. While TransCanada’s
   current pipeline is running at only about half capacity, it is still
   carrying a large volume of natural gas to customers in Ontario and
   Quebec.

   If Energy East proceeds, what will be the consequence of displacing
   this supply? Can industrial users be assured their natural gas
   requirements will continue to be met at a reasonable price?
   And what about residential consumers? Any measure adding to the already
   exorbitantly high cost of electric power in Ontario would be a cause
   for considerable concern.
