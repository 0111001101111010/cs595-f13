   Below are a few sources of financial aid that you might want to

   [101]educational benefits for service members.

   [102]Top

Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarships

   These scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit rather than
   financial need:
     * Army ROTC scholarships are offered at hundreds of colleges.
       Application packets, information about eligibility, and the
       telephone number of an ROTC advisor in your area are available from
       [103]College Army ROTC or 1-800-USA-ROTC (1-800-872-7682).
     * The Air Force ROTC college scholarship program targets students
       pursuing certain foreign language and technical degrees, although
       students entering a wide variety of majors may be accepted.
       Information about Air Force ROTC scholarships is available from
       [104]Air Force ROTC College Scholarship Section or 1-866-4-AFROTC
       (1-866-423-7682).
     * Navy ROTC offers both two-year and four-year scholarships, with
       options to join the Navy, the Marines, or the Navy Nursing Corps.
       For information and applications, contact [105]Naval Service
       Training Command or 1-800-NAV-ROTC (1-800-628-7682).
     * The Marine Officer NROTC Program pays your way through college at
       approved schools and offers an additional scholarship if you attend
       one of a list of approved Historically Black Colleges and
       Universities (known as HBCUs). [106]Learn about the Marine Officer
       NROTC Program and request more information.

Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Education Benefits

   The VA offers [108]education benefits for veterans and for their widows
   and dependents on its GI Bill site.

Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant or Additional Federal Pell Grant Funds

   If your parent or guardian died as a result of military service in Iraq
   or Afghanistan after the events of 9/11, you may be eligible for
   additional aid. To be eligible, at the time of your parent’s or
   guardian’s death, you must have been less than 24 years old or enrolled
   at least part-time at a college or career school. Payments will be
   adjusted if you are enrolled less than full-time.
     * [110]Federal Pell Grants: If you meet the requirements above and
       are eligible to receive a Pell Grant, you will receive an Expected
       Family Contribution (EFC) of zero, which maximizes your Pell Grant
       eligibility and can increase your eligibility for other federal
       student aid programs.
     * [111]Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants: If you meet the
       requirements above but are not eligible for a Pell Grant based on
       your EFC, you will be eligible to receive the Iraq and Afghanistan
       Service Grant. The maximum amount of the Iraq and Afghanistan
       Service Grant is the same as the maximum Pell Grant award. Your EFC
       will not be affected, and therefore neither will your eligibility
       for any need-based federal student aid.

Limited Interest Rates, No Accrual of Interest, and Deferment of Student
Loans

   To receive the benefits below, contact your [113]loan servicer for
   information about the documentation you must provide to show that you
   qualify.
     * Under the [114]Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, if you took out
       student loans prior to entering the military or being called to
       active duty, the interest rate on those loans will be limited to 6%
       during your active duty military service. This applies to both
       federal and private student loans (and other loans as well).
     * For all Direct Loans first disbursed on or after Oct. 1, 2008, no
       interest will be charged for a period of no more than 60 months
       while you are serving on active duty or performing qualifying
       National Guard duty during a war, other military operation, or
       national emergency and are serving in an area of hostilities
       qualifying for special pay. For Direct Consolidation Loans, this
       benefit applies to the portion of the consolidation loan that
       repaid loans first disbursed on or after Oct. 1, 2008.
     * You will qualify for deferment of repayment on any of your federal
       loans while serving on active duty in the military, or performing
       qualifying National Guard duty, during a war, military operation,
       or national emergency.  If your period of active duty service
       includes Oct. 1, 2007, or begins on or after that date, your
       deferment will be extended for an additional 180 days after the
       demobilization date for each period of qualifying service.
     * If you are a member of the National Guard or other reserve
       component of the U.S. armed forces (current or retired) and you are
       called or ordered to active duty while you are enrolled at least
       half-time at an eligible school or within six months of having been
       enrolled at least half-time, you qualify for deferment of repayment
       on your federal student loans during the 13 months following the
       end of your active duty service, or until you return to school on
       at least a half-time basis, whichever is earlier.
