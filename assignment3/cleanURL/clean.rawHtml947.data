   Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (February 20, 1844 – September 5, 1906) was an
   [48]Austrian physicist and philosopher whose greatest achievement was
   in the development of [49]statistical mechanics, which explains and
   predicts how the properties of [50]atoms (such as [51]mass, [52]charge,
   and structure) determine the physical properties of [53]matter (such as
   viscosity, [54]thermal conductivity, and diffusion).

Biography[55]Edit

Childhood and education[56]Edit

   Boltzmann was born in [57]Vienna, the capital of the [58]Austrian
   Empire. His father, Ludwig Georg Boltzmann, was a revenue official. His
   grandfather, who had moved to Vienna from Berlin, was a clock
   manufacturer, and Boltzmann’s mother, Katharina Pauernfeind, was
   originally from [59]Salzburg. He received his primary education from a
   private tutor at the home of his parents. Boltzmann attended high
   school in [60]Linz, [61]Upper Austria. When Boltzmann was 15 his father
   died.

   Boltzmann studied [62]physics at the [63]University of Vienna, starting
   in 1863. Among his teachers were [64]Josef Loschmidt, [65]Joseph
   Stefan, [66]Andreas von Ettingshausen and [67]Jozef Petzval. Boltzmann
   received his PhD degree in 1866 working under the supervision of
   Stefan; his dissertation was on [68]kinetic theory of gases. In 1867 he
   became a [69]Privatdozent (lecturer). After obtaining his doctorate
   degree, Boltzmann worked two more years as Stefan’s assistant. It was
   Stefan who introduced Boltzmann to [70]Maxwell's work.

Academic career[71]Edit

   In 1869 at age 25, thanks to a letter of recommendation written by
   Stefan,^[72][1] he was appointed full Professor of [73]Mathematical
   Physics at the [74]University of Graz in the province of [75]Styria. In
   1869 he spent several months in [76]Heidelberg working with [77]Robert
   Bunsen and [78]Leo Königsberger and then in 1871 he was with [79]Gustav
   Kirchhoff and [80]Hermann von Helmholtz in Berlin. In 1873 Boltzmann
   joined the University of Vienna as Professor of Mathematics and there
   he stayed until 1876.

   In 1872, long before women were admitted to Austrian universities, he
   met Henriette von Aigentler, an aspiring teacher of mathematics and
   physics in Graz. She was refused permission to audit lectures
   unofficially. Boltzmann advised her to appeal, which she did,
   successfully. On July 17, 1876 Ludwig Boltzmann married Henriette; they
   had three daughters and two sons. Boltzmann went back to [86]Graz to
   take up the chair of Experimental Physics. Among his students in Graz
   were [87]Svante Arrhenius and [88]Walther Nernst.^[89][2]^[90][3] He
   spent 14 happy years in Graz and it was there that he developed his
   statistical concept of nature. In 1885 he became a member of the
   Imperial [91]Austrian Academy of Sciences and in 1887 he became the
   President of the [92]University of Graz. He was elected a member of the
   [93]Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1888.

   Boltzmann was appointed to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the
   [94]University of Munich in [95]Bavaria, Germany in 1890. In 1893,
   Boltzmann succeeded his teacher [96]Joseph Stefan as Professor of
   Theoretical Physics at the University of Vienna.

Final years[97]Edit

   Boltzmann spent a great deal of effort in his final years defending his
   theories. He did not get along with some of his colleagues in Vienna,
   particularly [98]Ernst Mach, who became a professor of philosophy and
   history of sciences in 1895. That same year [99]Georg Helm and
   [100]Wilhelm Ostwald presented their position on Energetics, at a
   meeting in [101]Lübeck in 1895. They saw energy, and not matter, as the
   chief component of the universe. However, Boltzmann's position carried
   the day among other physicists who supported his atomic theories in the
   debate.^[102][4] Thereafter in 1900, Boltzmann went to the
   [103]University of Leipzig, on the invitation of [104]Wilhelm
   Ostwald.^[105][5] After the retirement of Mach due to bad health,
   Boltzmann came back to Vienna in 1902.^[106][6] In 1903 he founded the
   [107]Austrian Mathematical Society together with [108]Gustav von
   Escherich and [109]Emil Müller. His students included [110]Karl
   Przibram, [111]Paul Ehrenfest and [112]Lise Meitner.

   In Vienna, Boltzmann not only taught physics but also lectured on
   philosophy. Boltzmann’s lectures on [113]natural philosophy were very
   popular, and received a considerable attention at that time. His first
   lecture was an enormous success. Even though the largest lecture hall
   had been chosen for it, the people stood all the way down the
   staircase. Because of the great successes of Boltzmann’s philosophical
   lectures, the Emperor invited him for a reception at the Palace.

   Boltzmann was subject to rapid alternation of depressed moods with
   elevated, expansive or irritable moods, likely the symptoms of
   undiagnosed [114]bipolar disorder. He himself jestingly attributed his
   rapid swings in temperament to the fact that he was born during the
   night between [115]Shrove Tuesday and [116]Ash Wednesday.^[117][7]
   Meitner relates that those who were close to Boltzmann were aware of
   his bouts of severe depression and his suicide attempts.

   On September 5, 1906, while on a summer vacation in [118]Duino, near
   [119]Trieste, Boltzmann hanged himself during an attack of
   [120]depression.^[121][8]^[122][9] He is buried in the Viennese
   [123]Zentralfriedhof; his tombstone bears the inscription

          S = k \cdot \log W \,

   which should actually be read as:

          S = k \cdot \log_e W

Philosophy[124]Edit

   Boltzmann's kinetic theory of gases seemed to presuppose the reality of
   [125]atoms and [126]molecules, but almost all German philosophers and
   many scientists like [127]Ernst Mach and the physical chemist
   [128]Wilhelm Ostwald disbelieved their existence. During the 1890s
   Boltzmann attempted to formulate a compromise position which would
   allow both atomists and anti-atomists to do physics without arguing
   over atoms. His solution was to use [129]Hertz's theory that atoms were
   "Bilder", that is, models or pictures. Atomists could think the
   pictures were the real atoms while the anti-atomists could think of the
   pictures as representing a useful but unreal model, but this did not
   fully satisfy either group. Furthermore, Ostwald and many defenders of
   "pure thermodynamics" were trying hard to refute the kinetic theory of
   gases and statistical mechanics because of Boltzmann's assumptions
   about atoms and molecules and especially statistical interpretation of
   the second law.

   Around the turn of the century, Boltzmann's science was being
   threatened by another philosophical objection. Some physicists,
   including Mach's student, [130]Gustav Jaumann, interpreted Hertz to
   mean that all electromagnetic behavior is continuous, as if there were
   no atoms and molecules, and likewise as if all physical behavior were
   ultimately electromagnetic. This movement around 1900 deeply depressed
   Boltzmann since it could mean the end of his kinetic theory and
   statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics.

   After Mach's resignation in Vienna in 1901, Boltzmann returned there
   and decided to become a philosopher himself to refute philosophical
   objections to his physics, but he soon became discouraged again. In
   1904 at a physics conference in St. Louis most physicists seemed to
   reject atoms and he was not even invited to the physics section.
   Rather, he was stuck in a section called "applied mathematics," he
   violently attacked philosophy, especially on allegedly Darwinian
   grounds but actually in terms of [131]Lamarck's theory of the
   inheritance of acquired characteristics that people inherited bad
   philosophy from the past and that it was hard for scientists to
   overcome such inheritance.

   In 1905 Boltzmann corresponded extensively with the Austro-German
   philosopher [132]Franz Brentano with the hope of gaining a better
   mastery of philosophy, apparently, so that he could better refute its
   relevancy in science, but he became discouraged about this approach as
   well. In the following year 1906 his mental condition became so bad
   that he had to resign his position. He committed suicide in September
   of that same year by hanging himself while on vacation with his wife
   and daughter near Trieste, Italy.^[133][10]

Physics[134]Edit

   Boltzmann's most important scientific contributions were in
   [135]kinetic theory, including the [136]Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution
   for molecular speeds in a gas. In addition, [137]Maxwell–Boltzmann
   statistics and the [138]Boltzmann distribution over energies remain the
   foundations of [139]classical statistical mechanics. They are
   applicable to the many [140]phenomena that do not require [141]quantum
   statistics and provide a remarkable insight into the meaning of
   [142]temperature.

   region” (α, β) overlap.

   Much of the [143]physics establishment did not share his belief in the
   reality of [144]atoms and [145]molecules — a belief shared, however, by
   [146]Maxwell in [147]Scotland and [148]Gibbs in the United States; and
   by [149]most [150]chemists since the discoveries of [151]John Dalton in
   1808. He had a long-running dispute with the editor of the preeminent
   German physics journal of his day, who refused to let Boltzmann refer
   to atoms and molecules as anything other than convenient
   [152]theoretical constructs. Only a couple of years after Boltzmann's
   death, [153]Perrin's studies of [154]colloidal suspensions (1908–1909),
   based on [155]Einstein's [156]theoretical studies of 1905, confirmed
   the values of [157]Avogadro's number and [158]Boltzmann's constant, and
   convinced the world that the tiny particles [159]really exist.

   To quote [160]Planck, "The [161]logarithmic connection between
   [162]entropy and [163]probability was first stated by L. Boltzmann in
   his [164]kinetic theory of gases".^[165][11] This famous formula for
   entropy S is^[166][12]^[167][13]

          S = k \ln W \,

   where k = 1.3806505(24) × 10^−23 [168]J [169]K^−1 is [170]Boltzmann's
   constant, and ln is the [171]natural logarithm. W is
   Wahrscheinlichkeit, a German word meaning the [172]frequency of
   occurrence of a [173]macrostate^[174][14] or, more precisely, the
   number of possible [175]microstates corresponding to the macroscopic
   state of a system — number of (unobservable) "ways" in the (observable)
   [176]thermodynamic state of a system can be realized by assigning
   different [177]positions and [178]momenta to the various molecules.
   Boltzmann’s [179]paradigm was an [180]ideal gas of N identical
   particles, of which N[i] are in the ith microscopic condition (range)
   of position and momentum. W can be counted using the formula for
   [181]permutations

          W = \frac{N!}{\prod_i N_i!}

   where i ranges over all possible molecular conditions. ( ! denotes
   [182]factorial.) The "correction" in the denominator is because
   identical particles in the same condition are [183]indistinguishable.

   Boltzmann was also one of the founders of quantum mechanics due to his
   suggestion in 1877 that the energy levels of a physical system could be
   discrete.

   The equation for S is engraved on Boltzmann's [184]tombstone at the
   Vienna [185]Zentralfriedhof — his second grave.

The Boltzmann equation[186]Edit

   University of Vienna.
   Main article: [187]Boltzmann equation

   The Boltzmann equation was developed to describe the dynamics of an
   ideal gas.

          \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+ v \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+
          \frac{F}{m} \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial
          f}{\partial t}\left.{\!\!\frac{}{}}\right|_\mathrm{collision}

   where ƒ represents the distribution function of single-particle
   position and momentum at a given time (see the [188]Maxwell–Boltzmann
   distribution), F is a force, m is the mass of a particle, t is the time
   and v is an average velocity of particles.

   This equation describes the [189]temporal and [190]spatial variation of
   the probability distribution for the position and momentum of a density
   distribution of a cloud of points in single-particle [191]phase space.
   (See [192]Hamiltonian mechanics.) The first term on the left-hand side
   represents the explicit time variation of the distribution function,
   while the second term gives the spatial variation, and the third term
   describes the effect of any force acting on the particles. The
   right-hand side of the equation represents the effect of collisions.

   entropy formula.

   In principle, the above equation completely describes the dynamics of
   an ensemble of gas particles, given appropriate [194]boundary
   conditions. This first-order [195]differential equation has a
   deceptively simple appearance, since ƒ can represent an arbitrary
   single-particle distribution function. Also, the [196]force acting on
   the particles depends directly on the velocity distribution function ƒ.
   The Boltzmann equation is notoriously difficult to [197]integrate.
   [198]David Hilbert spent years trying to solve it without any real
   success.

   The form of the collision term assumed by Boltzmann was approximate.
   However for an ideal gas the standard [199]Chapman–Enskog solution of
   the Boltzmann equation is highly accurate. It is expected to lead to
   incorrect results for an ideal gas only under [200]shock wave
   conditions.

   Boltzmann tried for many years to "prove" the [201]second law of
   thermodynamics using his gas-dynamical equation — his famous
   [202]H-theorem. However the key assumption he made in formulating the
   collision term was "[203]molecular chaos", an assumption which breaks
   [204]time-reversal symmetry as is necessary for anything which could
   imply the second law. It was from the probabilistic assumption alone
   that Boltzmann's apparent success emanated, so his long dispute with
   [205]Loschmidt and others over [206]Loschmidt's paradox ultimately
   ended in his failure.

   Finally, in the 1970s [207]E.G.D. Cohen and J.R. Dorfman proved that a
   systematic (power series) extension of the Boltzmann equation to high
   densities is mathematically impossible. Consequently
   [208]nonequilibrium statistical mechanics for dense gases and
   [209]liquids focuses on the [210]Green–Kubo relations, the
   [211]fluctuation theorem, and other approaches instead.

The Second Law as a law of disorder[212]Edit

   The idea that the [213]second law of thermodynamics or "entropy law" is
   a law of disorder (or that dynamically ordered states are "infinitely
   improbable") is due to Boltzmann's view of the second law. In
   particular, it was his attempt to reduce it to a [214]stochastic
   collision function, or law of probability following from the random
   collisions of mechanical particles. Following Maxwell,^[215][15]
   Boltzmann modeled gas molecules as colliding billiard balls in a box,
   noting that with each collision nonequilibrium velocity distributions
   (groups of molecules moving at the same speed and in the same
   direction) would become increasingly disordered leading to a final
   state of macroscopic uniformity and maximum microscopic disorder or the
   state of maximum entropy (where the macroscopic uniformity corresponds
   to the obliteration of all field potentials or gradients).^[216][16]
   The second law, he argued, was thus simply the result of the fact that
   in a world of mechanically colliding particles disordered states are
   the most probable. Because there are so many more possible disordered
   states than ordered ones, a system will almost always be found either
   in the state of maximum disorder – the macrostate with the greatest
   number of accessible microstates such as a gas in a box at equilibrium
   – or moving towards it. A dynamically ordered state, one with molecules
   moving "at the same speed and in the same direction," Boltzmann
   concluded, is thus "the most improbable case conceivable...an
   infinitely improbable configuration of energy."^[217][17]

   Boltzmann said that the second law of thermodynamics is only a
   statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy is analogous to the
   disordering of an initially ordered [218]pack of cards under repeated
   shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original
   order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe
   must some day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set
   out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes
   somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will
   probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.)^[219][18] The tendency
   for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in
   thermodynamics, but is easy to understand from the standpoint of the
   theory of probability. Consider two ordinary [220]dice, with both sixes
   face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two
   sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random
   motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of
   molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to
   change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the
   millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the
   probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that
   the system must move to one of the more probable states.^[221][19]
   However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a
   pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and
   since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of
   dice will tend to be a pair of sixes. And the cards, when shuffled,
   will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in
   its whole they are disordered.

Energetics of evolution[222]Edit

   Boltzmann's views played an essential role in the development of
   [223]energetics, the scientific study of energy flows under
   transformation. In 1922, for example, [224]Alfred J. Lotka referred to
   Boltzmann as one of the first proponents of the proposition that
   available energy can be understood as the fundamental object under
   contention in the biological, or life-struggle and therefore also in
   the evolution of the organic world.^[225][20] Lotka interpreted
   Boltzmann's view to imply that available energy could be the central
   concept that unified physics and biology as a quantitative physical
   principle of evolution. In the foreword to Boltzmann's Theoretical
   Physics and Philosophical Problems, S.R. de Groot noted that
   “ Boltzmann had a tremendous admiration for Darwin and he wished to
     extend Darwinism from biological to cultural evolution. In fact he
     considered biological and cultural evolution as one and the same
     things. ... In short, cultural evolution was a physical process taking
     place in the brain. Boltzmann included ethics in the ideas which
     developed in this fashion ...                                         ”

   [226]Howard T. Odum later sought to develop these views when looking at
   the evolution of ecological systems, and suggested that the
   [227]maximum power principle was an example of Darwin's law of
   [228]natural selection.
