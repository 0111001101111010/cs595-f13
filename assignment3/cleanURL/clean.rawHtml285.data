A Conversation With A Trader Who Couldn’t Care Less About The Debt Ceiling

   whatever 2 A Conversation With A Trader Who Couldnt Care Less About The
   Debt Ceiling

   [20]apollonia666

   The debt ceiling debate is an awful, almost-annual slugfest that
   equally stupefies & mystifies everyone on Wall Street.

   Analysts & journalists alike find their inboxes flooded with bank
   reports approximately the downside of the country’s descent into
   shutdown in the event that the government runs out of cash. And in the
   words of [21]Jeff Macke everyone’s wondering — “why are we beholden to
   these idiots?”

   Everyone except for the most refreshing guys in finance right now. Why
   are they refreshing? Because they do not care at all — not even one
   bit— approximately the debt ceiling fight. They probably don’t even
   know who Senator Ted Cruz is.

   And who are they?

   These are your Wall Street chart guys — the guys that trade based
   solely on price movement. Some of them are [22]Chartered Market
   Technicians, & some of them just really liked graphs when they were
   kids. Regardless, at times like these when you want to filter out the
   screeching noise coming from D.C., they’re the best people to know.

   All it takes to obtain some perspective is a quick e-mail. In my case,
   it was to J.C. Parets, founder & CEO of Eagle Bay Capital.

   Subject line: Do you care approximately the debt ceiling?

   (Nothing in the body of the e-mail. This is a satisfactory way to write
   an e-mail to a Wall Streeter.)

   The response. Verbatim: “You’re barking up the wrong tree. I’m just
   here looking at my charts minding my own business you know what I’m
   saying? I don’t have time to worry approximately debt ceilings & the
   government. These people are a hot mess. I can’t…. You received a bunch
   of clowns reading each other Dr. Seuss. Why should I worry
   approximately what they’re doing, or not doing?”

   This isn’t to say that Parets doesn‘t know what’s coming. It’s just
   that his charts tell him, not Ted Cruz.

   And in the charts, the signs of something nasty coming on have been
   appearing for a while.

   “With each new high in the SP 500, less & less stocks are
   participating,” Parets wrote. “No bueno. Less stocks above their 200
   day (in up trends) with each new high, & less NYSE new 52-wk highs with
   each new high. This is all pointing to lower prices for averages. This
   is a “market of stocks” after all no?”

   In other words, the market’s been running out of steam. To Parets, it
   doesn‘t matter why, especially not if it has to do with unnecessary
   political squabbling.

   “Because what the **** do natural gas futures have to do with Dr.
   Seuss,” he asked.

   So yes, the financial media will trot out Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd
   Blankfein, & he’ll say the same thing he says every time.[23] ‘I’m in
   the business of risk management,” he’ll say, implying gently that
   Washington is introducing needless risk in the market.

   “I don’t like the ballooning fight over the debt ceiling,” Blankfein
   will say, without mentioning that it already looks offensive in charts,
   of course.

   It’s going to waste us some money, is what he means.

   And here’s the thing: Everyone talks approximately how Wall Street,
   with its seemingly endless supply of campaign donations, owns
   Washington’s politicians.

   How is it that on this issue one issue it seems like Wall Street has no
   say whatsoever?

   It boggles the mind.
