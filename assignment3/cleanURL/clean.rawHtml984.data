   The best brands use our products
     __________________________________________________________________

We built the company that we’d want to do business with. We hope you do too.

1

Useful is forever

   Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful
   software that does just what you need and nothing you don’t.

2

Great service is everything

   We’re famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to
   make sure we live up to that reputation every day. [11]See how our
   customers rate our service.

3

Clarity is king

   Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no
   place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.

4

Our customers are our investors

   Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We
   answer to them — not investors, the stock market, or a board of
   directors.

5

The basics are beautiful

   We’ll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service,
   ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer’s time,
   money, and trust.

6

No hidden fees or secret prices

   We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our
   prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter
   who you are.

7

Software should be easy

   Our products are intuitive. You’ll pick them up in seconds or minutes,
   not hours, days or weeks. We don’t sell you training because you don’t
   need it.

8

Long-term contracts are obscene

   No one likes being locked into something they don’t want anymore. Our
   customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No
   setup/termination fees either.
