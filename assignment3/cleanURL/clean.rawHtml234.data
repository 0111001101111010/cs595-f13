   This website as well as HTML5 Cart make heavy use of JavaScript, which
   is disabled in your browser. For complete experience, please, enable
   JavaScript and reload the page.

HTML^5 Cart is an elegant, platform-independent, powerful,
[15]feature-complete and fully customizable shopping cart solution with easy
to use [16]API, amazing [17]tools and coded entirely in [18]HTML5,
[19]JavaScript and [20]CSS3.

Try out the Demo

   Select quantity and click to add dummy items to the cart. Once added,
   you can click the shopping cart icon next to the menu items on top to
   modify the basket and proceed to the checkout.

   This is a demo of the HTML5 Shopping Cart without a [21]payment
   provider. Navigate to [22]this page if you wish to purchase a license
   for the component (all our commercial licenses include payment
   providers). Click [23]here to check the cart mode with add to cart
   buttons implementation of HTML5 Cart or [24]here to check HTML5 Cart
   working with a different [25]items data file.

Features

     * Platform-independent
       HTML^5 Cart operates fully in the browser, and does not depend on
       the type of the web-server you are using.
     *
     * Lightweight and Elegant
       The entire HTML^5 Cart (CSS, JavaScript and template files) is just
       about 40KB minified and g-zipped.
     *
     * Support for Different Payment Gateways
       Currently, the small business and enterprise [26]licenses come with
       one payment provider - PayPal, but we are working on support for
       Google Checkout and Amazon Payments. The basic version of HTML^5
       Cart does not include a payment provider, but you can easily create
       one, using our API, which allows the integration of any payment
       provider. For more information about payment providers, please,
       check our [27]Documentation and API page.
     *
     * HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Driven
       Amazingly fast and responsive. Built with best practices and latest
       development trends in mind.
     *
     * External Templates
       If you know HTML and CSS you can easily change the looks and the
       rendering of HTML^5 Cart.
     *
     * International Currency Support
       HTML^5 Cart will support any currency, supported by the selected
       [28]payment provider. It will also add automatically the currency
       symbol (if available) along with the currency code.
     *
     * Flexible Licenses
       We provide flexible and affordable licenses for any businesses. For
       more information, please, check our [29]licenses page.
     *
     * Add to Cart Buttons
       If you do not want to use the "shop" mode of HTML^5 Cart, you can
       associate the items you sell on your website with our [30]add to
       cart buttons. This can done extremely easy, and any license of
       HTML^5 Cart is shipped with 5 ready to use add to cart buttons.
       Moreover, you can easily create your own buttons with CSS.
     *
     * Easy to Install, Configure and Run.
       No data bases and server setup - just pure client-side
       implementation. Basically, what you need to do is adding a few
       JavaScript and CSS files, defining a few configuration properties
       and include your items to a simple JSON file. Please, check the
       [31]documentation for a jump start using HTML^5 Cart.
     *
     * Modes
       HTML^5 Cart supports two operation modes - "cart" (default) and
       "shop". Please, check our [32]documentation page for more info
       about modes.
     *
     * Localizable
       The current version of HTML^5 Cart comes with English and Bulgarian
       languages, but creating a [33]language file is a matter of minutes
       - all you have to do is to edit a simple JSON file.
     *
     * Themes
       The support for themes is currently under development and will be
       released soon.
