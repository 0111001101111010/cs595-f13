Shutdown letdown, but what’s next?

   image

   "We have the best government that money can buy."

   -Mark Twain

   Wasn’t this supposed to happen several months ago, but we somehow put
   aside our differences and made it work?  Oh right, we agreed not to
   think about it until later (which is now).  So NASA is out of funding,
   the CDC furloughed 8,754 workers (diseases have furloughed zero), and
   the NIH has stopped its research and halted new grants.  So it
   happened.  But do I dare ask, is this all bad?  (Yes, it’s bad, but
   stay with me here).  All day in the lab, I heard people complaining
   about missing online data sets and publications, government websites
   going down, grant reviews coming to a screeching halt, and job
   interviews at the NIH being up in the air.  Moreover, social media has
   been lighting up with people expressing how they didn’t realize how
   many government resources they needed just to get through their day
   conducting scientific research.

   All of this has made me wonder, will this make scientists get involved
   in scientific policy?  The popular opinion is that science is becoming
   an increasingly prominent issue throughout the world.  Yet, most of the
   policies are dictated by people without technical training, and
   practicing scientists have been reluctant participants in the national
   conversation.  Rees Kassen of the University of Ottawa wrote an
   excellent [8]editorial in Nature about this very issue.  Kassen gives
   an example of the Canadian parliament.  Of the 308 members of
   parliament, 17 hold a degree in the natural sciences, engineering, or
   health sciences.  If these numbers reflected national university
   graduation rates, there would be 98 members of parliament with formal
   scientific training.  So the burden of nurturing the social momentum of
   science really falls on its practitioners.  Kassen states that,

   "researchers must recognize that poor scientific decisions in politics
   do not necessarily result from a lack of understanding. They are,
   rather, a failure of scientists to communicate their message
   effectively in what is ultimately a political, not a scientific arena."

   Moreover, Kassen goes on to point out a few interesting points of view
   that I think are true.  He asserts that,

   "scientists think too highly of their own view of the world and fail to
   appreciate the complex, multifarious nature of decision making."

   And also, that to a politician,

   "science is an interest group like any other."

   Kassen’s observations invoke a 2004 remark from former congressman
   Sherwood Boehlert, who was then the chair of the House Science
   Committee.  As he stated,

   "The argument that science funding is a long-term national investment
   does nothing to set scientists apart.  All that sets them apart is that
   scientists are the only group that thinks they’re making a unique
   argument."

   What a quote, eh?  It seems to confirm Kassen’s view that science is
   funded as an interest group.  So if the members of that group (the
   scientists) don’t voice strong displeasure and opposition against
   funding cuts, it might make it seem that we don’t really care about the
   cuts, doesn’t it? Many more have expressed this same view that
   scientists need to get involved in policy decisions.  I chose this one
   because it’s a gem.  If the Kassen piece didn’t grab you, how about
   a [9]plea by Newt Gingrich (of all people)!  Gingrich was a keynote
   speaker at the 2007 Society for Neuroscience Conference in San Diego (I
   was in the audience). Predictably, he was asked a lot of tough
   questions by the crowd, but his message was surprising.  He pleaded
   with the neuroscientists to get involved and help politician make
   informed decisions about scientific policy.  I don’t care much for the
   guy as a politician, but I found myself appreciating what he had to
   say.


   The shutdown is maddening and sad.  But if anything good comes out of
   this, I hope that it makes a generation of young scientists realize how
   much government support is require on a daily basis to accomplish
   science.  I hope it serves as a call to action to get involved and help
   politicians foster the policies that allow science in the United States
   to thrive.  I think it’s long overdue for the scientific community to
   start educating the public about the values of science, and make a case
   for the necessity of investing in its development.

Nuclear Gastronomy

   image

   "The radiation left over from the Big Bang is the same as that in your
   microwave oven but very much less powerful. It would heat your pizza
   only to minus 271.3 degrees celsius - not much good for defrosting the
   pizza, let alone cooking it."

   -Stephen Hawking


   There have often been times in my career when I was stuck in the lab
   without any easy way of getting or making food.  This is the worst.  A
   long experiment (usually critical) makes for a long day.  But it’s even
   longer when you are hungry and irritable.  At these critical times, I
   found it’s useful to have a few non-perishable food items at work to
   make a quick meal with the resources available.  If anything, cooking
   in the lab makes for a few welcome minutes of distraction between
   experiments.  Here, I’ll periodically post some recipes that I’ve
   employed over the years.  Remember, all are laboratory-tested and
   scientist (at least this one) approved.

   The recipes for nuclear gastronomy follow a few rules:

   Rule #1: It must be tasty

   Rule #2: It must be tasty

   Rule #3: All ingredients must fit inside a coffee mug

   Rule #4: Everything must be cooked in a microwave

   Rule #5: Most of the recipe ingredients must be non-perishable (there
   maybe special exceptions)

   Rule #6: All recipes must take less than 15 minutes to prepare

   Mac and Cheese

   Ingredients:

   1/3 Cup pasta

   1/2 Cup water

   1/4 Cup milk, or 1 Tablespoon of instant dry milk

   1/4 Cup shredded cheddar cheese

   1) Combine the pasta and water in your mug.  Microwave on high at two
   minute intervals and stir the pasta between intervals.  Keep going
   until the water is absorbed and the pasta is soft (typically between 4
   - 6 minutes)

   Note: The water may boil over during the heating.  If this keeps
   happening, cut down the duration of the heating intervals.

   2) Add the milk and the cheese and microwave until the cheese is melted
   (typically about a minute).

   Note: If using powder milk: you may need to add a little water to
   dissolve the milk, and if you’re a biologist, I highly recommend that
   you NOT use the lab milk for western blotting.

   3) Stir and enjoy.

Krebs on his cycle

   image

   A groaner for sure, but I had to do it.  Picture of Hans Krebs, Nobel
   laureate and discoverer of metabolic processes such as the urea cycle
   and the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle).  Responsible
   for making me think biochemical reactions literally occurred as a
   series of rotating circles in cells until I was a 21-year old college
   student.

Perhaps the worst day of scientific work. Ever.

   image

   Wheeler Peak, Nevada

   “Of all the trees we could have hit, we had to get the one that hits
   back!”

   -Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

   This story takes a bad day at work to a whole new level.  Donald Rusk
   Currey was a promising graduate student at the University of North
   Carolina at Chapel Hill.  His Ph.D. dissertation pioneered the use of
   dendrochronology techniques (looking at tree ring patterns) to study
   dynamic changes in the Earth’s climate.  In particular, Donald was
   interested in knowing what tree ring patterns could tell us about the
   cooling of the earth seen in Medieval times known as the [15]Little Ice
   Age.

   In 1963, Donald was a 30 year old scientist who became aware of a
   population of Bristlecone Pine trees on Wheeler peak. As Bristle cone
   pines in the White Mountains of California were discovered to be older
   than any species yet dated, Donald was particularly interested in
   taking core samples from these trees to see what they could tell us
   about past and current climate changes (rain amounts, temperature,
   etc).

   image

   Bristlecone Pine Tree

   In the summer of 1964, encouraged in his scientific pursuits by a grant
   from the National Science Foundation, Donald made a trip out to Nevada
   to obtain samples from the Bristlecone pines.  He climbed Wheeler peak
   and took several cores from trees on the mountain.  To his delight, he
   found that their ages exceed 3000 years (How cool is that!).  Donald
   became particularly captivated by one Bristlecone tree that had such a
   tortuous look that he hypothesized its age must surpass the ones he had
   already sampled.  He designated this tree WPN-114, and dug in with his
   specialized hand-powered drill purchased from Sweden.  Immediately, he
   noticed that obtaining a core sample from WPN-114 was very difficult.
   (Ping!) His first attempt caused the drill bit to break in the trunk of
   the tree.  When he started a second bore in the trunk with his backup
   drill, (Ping!) the second drill bit also broke in the tree.  Out of
   tools and dejected, Donald hiked back down the peak.  At this point,
   Donald was frantic.  He knew this was the only trip he would make to
   Nevada that year, and worse, all of his tools needed for data
   collection were now stuck inside the trunk of a tree.  His trip out
   west appeared to be in jeopardy.

   In desperation, Donald located the district forest ranger office and
   explained his situation.  Surprisingly, the forest rangers told him not
   to worry.  Since Donald’s tree was not a notable landmark, they would
   cut the tree down for him.  On August 6, 1964, Donald and the forest
   rangers climbed up Wheeler peak and down went WPN-114, and Donald was
   able to obtain several slabs of the tree to take back with him.  He
   began to manually count of the rings.  After the first day, Donald was
   able to count 1000 rings, putting him in medieval times…

   Day 2…2000 (Jesus times)

   Day 3…3000 (David and Goliath times)

   Day 4…4844 (End of the Neolithic era)!

   At this point, Donald paused. He realized he had in his possession the
   remnants of a 4844 year old organism.  Until then, the oldest living
   thing ever recorded had been another tree dated at 4600 years.  Imagine
   the panic Donald Rusk must have felt at realizing that he just killed
   the oldest living thing known to man.  Staying true to his scientific
   training, Donald counted again, and again, but to no avail.  Every
   count showed that Donald had in his possession the remnants of the
   oldest living life form on the planet. Moreover, the locals and tree
   aficionados were inclined to naming the Bristlecone pines in the area.
    And ironically, WPN-114 wasn’t a nameless landmark, it was known as
   the Prometheus tree, after the mythological champion of mankind who
   stole fire from the gods to give to humans.

   Donald R. Currey (1965) Ecology

   So imagine yourself in this situation.  You’re 30, on your way to a
   Ph.D., and feeling good about finally creating a professional
   reputation for yourself.  Then you come to the realization that in your
   enthusiasm, you annihilated the oldest thing to inhabit this planet.
   What do you do?  Despite all of the irony already embedded in this
   story, what makes this story truly remarkable is what Donald Currey did
   next.  He published his data.  I think it would be completely
   understandable if Donald pretended this never happened, or reported the
   tree as having fewer rings than in reality.  But Donald stuck to the
   truth.  He published his findings in the journal Ecology in 1965, and I
   think it’s fair to say that he knew that his ‘work’ would cause an
   uproar.  For example, the Little Ice Age is attributed to have occurred
   between ~1350 - 1850 A.D., but in the paper, Donald attributes the era
   to be from 2000 years ago to the present.  Presumably, in an attempt to
   soften the criticism of why he was taking samples from such old trees
   in the first place.  Despite this, Donald went through with the hard
   thing.  He told the truth and accurately reported his findings even
   though he knew it threatened to destroy his budding career and
   scientific reputation.


   As you can imagine, there was a lot of public anger in the years
   following its publication.  Donald never talked publicly about the
   Prometheus tree.  But despite the magnitude of his error (and perhaps
   because of his intellectual courage), Donald continued to pursue
   science.  He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Kansas in 1969 and
   went on to have a fruitful academic career as a professor at the
   University of Utah, where he continued his work with Bristlecone pines
   in the Great Basin.  He became a well respected scientist and a
   champion of environmental issues. When it came time to protect the
   Bristlecone pines, Donald personally lobbied Congress to designate the
   Great Basin as a national park. Donald passed away in 2004 at the age
   of 70.  The University of Utah department of Geography has endowed a
   scholarship in his name.

The most human pursuit of human pursuits

   image

   “And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those
   people and their homes had been.  But she did look back, and I love her
   for that, because it was so human.  So she was turned into a pillar of
   salt.  So it goes.”

   -Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five

   Kurt Vonnegut was referring to the Biblical story of Lot from the Book
   of Genesis.  Lot and Sarah were spared from the destruction of Sodom
   and Gomorrah, and on the orders of God, were explicitly told not to
   look back while fleeing God’s destruction of those cities.  Of course,
   curiosity got the best of Sarah, and so she looked back and was
   punished by transforming into a pillar of salt.  This is the story
   that’s stayed with me throughout my scientific career.  Not because I’m
   religious (I’m not), or because I read the Bible (I don’t.  Okay, my
   parents made me a long time ago), but because embedded in this ancient
   story is the paradoxical nature of what it is to be human.  On the one
   hand, we’re hopelessly inept creatures who can’t obey a simple command,
   on the other hand, we’re fiercely curious beings willing to pursue
   knowledge despite the consequences.  Quite simply, science is an
   entirely human endeavor, and arguably, it is THE most human of human
   activities.  It is conducted by imperfect creatures struggling with
   confusion, errors, emotions, and temptations.  It shouldn’t work, but
   miraculously, it does and it thrives.  Science works because of two
   beautiful cogs within our being: our willingness to fail (repeatedly),
   and above all else, our insatiable curiosity.

   So that’s pretty much all I’m going to say about the obvious: the
   pursuit of scientific truth is in our DNA (no pun intended).  The drive
   to fulfill our curiosity reflects some of the very best of what it is
   to be human.  But I’m really here to illustrate the parts of science
   that make you cringe, shake your head, and hopefully make you see that
   science is really a collection of genuine but flawed humans trying
   their best.  This blog is dedicated to telling the stories in science
   that reveal more about our humanity than about science (hence, “science
   as folk”).

   This seems like a good place to start.  Recently, I read a great piece
   by John Skylar entitled “[18]Why you DON’T actually fucking love
   science”.  In it, John makes the point that science is produced by
   people who endure years of sacrifice, especially in the face of federal
   budget cuts toward scientific research.  For example, a staple source
   of funding for biomedical research in academia is grants awarded to
   professors by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the RO1 grant.
   As John put it, this is the “I made it” grant, and it is the money that
   pays for the supplies, equipment, laboratory space, and the salaries of
   people doing the research.

   The following is a graph provided by the NIH that shows a sharp
   increase starting in the last 10 years or so for the average age of a
   FIRST time recipient (that’s right, first time).  Mind you, these are
   scholars who have invested 4 years to complete a bachelor’s degree in
   science, ~6 years to complete their Ph.D., and ~5 years of postdoctoral
   training (and that’s pretty much the minimum).  Why is it going up?

   NIH-Graph

   Source: National Institutes of Health

   Good question.  The answer is in the NIH budget.  The amount of money
   the NIH has to give out has stagnated and slowly decreased in the last
   10 years.

   of American Societies for Experimental Biology

   So let’s pause for a minute and think about the implications of this.
   The pot of money that funds scientific careers has dwindled over the
   last ten years, and this has pushed the age at which scientists start
   their independent careers into the 40’s.  Admittedly, this sounds bad.
   But scientists are a plucky bunch lacking any emotions, so they should
   be able to handle this disappointment without letting it affect their
   work, right?  Well, let’s look at some additional data.  One of the
   worst things that can happen to a scientist is a retraction of their
   work.  Scientific journals reserve the right to publicly strike a paper
   out of existence if the work is proven to have errors that change the
   conclusions of that paper at a later date (i.e., fabrication of data,
   incorrect analysis, etc.).  As science has grown, the number of papers
   that have been retracted has also increased.

   image

   Source: [21]Steen RG, Casadevall, A, Fang FC. PLOS One (2013)

   Importantly, these increases don’t just reflect an overall rise in the
   number of retractions, but the percentage of publications that have
   been retracted has dramatically increased in the past few years.  So
   we’re seeing a real acceleration in the number of retractions in the
   literature.

   Is the increase in difficulty of attaining and maintaining a career in
   science related to the recent increase in the number of retractions?
   Let’s see what happens when we combine the two previous graphs.

   image

   It sure seems suspicious, doesn’t it?  On a human level, this makes a
   lot of sense.  Scientific research has been contracting in the United
   States , and these are desperate times for a lot of folks.  Indeed, the
   wavering support of science by the federal government leaves a lot to
   be desired, and in the end will hinder scientific progress.  But before
   I make it sound like science is going to the crooks, it’s critical that
   I mention a few things to this discussion.  Science works through a
   collective test of time.  What I mean is that once a theory is
   proposed, the scientific community goes to work to test this theory
   through their own experimentation.  Reproducible results are confirmed
   and irreproducible results are discarded, thus producing a body of
   scientific knowledge through the action of group intelligence.  This is
   a critical aspect of scientific discovery.  So although the rate of
   retractions is surely increasing, the dramatic increase in the last few
   years may not truly reflect a substantial increase in deceptive
   practices.  Indeed, due to several high profile cases of scientific
   fraud in the past decade, journals have increased their efforts to weed
   out fraudulent work.  So some of this increase in the number of
   retractions simply reflects better methods to detect errors, or put in
   a more positive light, science is evolving better methods of
   self-correction.  But needless to say, the very fact that the
   scientific community needs to divert already limited resources to
   detect increasing amounts of fraudulent work serves to further limit
   our progress.

   I also want to point out a couple more things that speaks to the
   honesty of the scientific community.  First, not all retractions
   reflect fraud or data fabrication.  In many cases, papers are retracted
   because of genuine errors, and often times, the papers are retracted
   voluntarily by the investigators once they realize their mistakes.  For
   an example, see [22]here.  And perhaps most importantly, the number of
   retracted papers represents just a tiny fraction of scientific
   publications produced each year.  Between 1973 and 2011, 21.2 million
   journal articles were published according to PubMed.  Of those, 890
   articles were retracted, producing a retraction rate of 1 in 23,799
   articles, or about 0.004%.  Compare that to an error rate of ~2% for
   the U.S. Postal Service, and it looks pretty good.  This is perhaps the
   most impressive part of all of this.  There are a few bad apples out
   there for sure, but despite all of the hardships endured by
   researchers, and the sad state of scientific funding, science continues
   to hold its integrity.  In short, science is almost entirely composed
   of honest people working hard to produce innovative work on a daily
   basis.  Kind of makes you feel good about human nature and for the
   future of our species, doesn’t it?
