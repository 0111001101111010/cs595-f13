Learning Resources Jumbo Magnifiers Review & Giveaway!

   September 24, 2013 [60]15 Comments

   [61]Learning Resources

   Big M (age 3) loves anything related to science and exploration. When
   [62]Learning Resources sent us a set of [63]Primary Science Jumbo
   Magnifiers, he was thrilled to open them and try them out. Magnifying
   glasses are pretty interesting to any kid, but these jumbo magnifiers
   are especially cool because they are very large, brightly colored and
   durable for little kids to explore with.

   Learning Resources Jumbo Magnifiers Review

   The set includes 6 magnifiers, each a different color, with a
   convenient stand to keep them in. Whether you’re homeschooling or using
   these in a classroom, these rainbow magnifiers are a great learning
   tool for science lessons. They are also fun for playtime and even my
   9-month-old is fascinated by them.

   Learning Resources Jumbo Magnifiers Review

   The magnifiers are 8″ long and the lenses are made of thick plastic
   that actually magnifies really well, enlarging objects 4.5x. You can
   really get a good look at a bug or other small object with these!

   Learning Resources Jumbo Magnifiers Review

   Each magnifier has a flip-out stand that allows you to position the
   magnifier hands-free to better observe an object. I could particularly
   see using this feature in a classroom setting where you could have each
   of the 6 magnifiers positioned to look at different objects, leaving
   the students hands-free to draw or answer questions as they see the
   items close up.

   Learning Resources Jumbo Magnifiers Review

   This is a simple but great set and I know we will use it for many
   things, both in school and during playtime!

       I really like that the magnifying glass is made of thick plastic so
       if my youngest were to get a hold of it and bang it around it
       wouldn’t break easily

       I like the different colors! Makes it a fun game to find something
       that matched the color to look at through the glass.

       Kids seem to be attracted to colors and these surely have it. My
       grandson would love using to look at bugs on the ground

About Me

   I'm Ashlyn and the words "Daily Mothering" pretty much describe who I
   am and what I do. [newpp1.jpg] I am a wife to my wonderful husband of 5
   years and a stay-at-home mom to our two amazing little boys (Big M is
   almost 3 years old and Little M is 8 months old) and another precious
   baby on the way (due May 1, 2014). When I'm not cleaning the house,
   playing with the boys, or changing diapers, I love to shop, sew, watch
   movies, sleep (ha!), and of course write in my blog!
