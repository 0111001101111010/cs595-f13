We Are All Part-Time Vegans Now

   Have you enjoyed a salad of greens and fresh veggies for lunch
   recently? Or a dinner of pasta (made without eggs), mixed with olives
   and tomatoes? If so, even if you ate cheese or meat or fish on other
   days, you're a part-time vegan.

   Writing in The New York Times last week, [29]Mark Bittman argued that
   the fall season is a fabulous time to take up a part-time vegan diet,
   because so many locally-grown fruits and vegetables are available. The
   more of us who opt to do that, he said, the better:

   It's increasingly evident that a part-time vegan diet—one that
   emphasizes minimally processed plant food at the expense of everything
   else—is the direction that will do the most to benefit human health,
   increase animal welfare and reduce environmental impact.

   [30]I care a lot about animal welfare and it's pretty clear too that
   meat-eating is linked to global warming, as Bittman detailed [31]in an
   earlier column.

   For these reasons, and because it strikes me as profoundly realistic, I
   am attracted to Bittman's part-time-veganism advocacy, which he
   develops fully in a book that I plan to read. That volume is called
   [32]Vegan Before Six, with "six" as in six o'clock: be vegan before
   dinnertime, eat other foods in moderation at and after dinner.

   Why do I say this is a "realistic" view? Because, let's face it,
   full-time veganism or even vegetarianism isn't for everyone. My own way
   of eating is conventionally described as pescatarian: I eat fish, but
   not other meats. I don't count as a vegetarian because of the fish, and
   because I eat cheese, yogurt and other dairy products.

   But according to Bittman, I'm also a part-time vegan; I sometimes eat
   meals with no animal products at all. And over time, I would like to
   become more of a part-time vegan.

   Now, I'm really aware that the notion of a part-time vegan diet as a
   laudable goal will upset some full-time vegans. Kathy Freston, a vegan,
   [33]admits it does give her pause to support the vegan-before-6
   concept: "If vegan is better for animals and the environment before 6,
   surely it's also better after 6," as she puts it.

   Other vegan activists go further, arguing that veganism is not merely
   about food choice but also involves a life [34]commitment to fight
   speciesism in all its forms. From this perspective, [35]ethical
   veganism overlaps with, but is more than, dietary veganism.

   Freston is right though, I think, to recognize the benefits of any
   degree of veganism: part-time veganism can be "transformational," she
   says, echoing Bittman. It's better for our health, for animals and for
   the Earth. She even predicts that those of us who embrace part-time
   veganism may well shift over time to make veganism more and more a part
   of our lives.

   Here is a perspective — Bittman's, Freston's — that is open, inviting
   and inclusive. It is in this spirit that I'm wishing everyone a happy,
   and maybe even a transformational, autumn.

Are Women Less Corrupt Than Men?
