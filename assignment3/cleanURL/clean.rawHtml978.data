Binaural Beats Technology

   [36]ishot 464 Binaural Beats Technology [37]Binaural beats are based
   upon what is known as “beats”, “subjective tones”, or “difference
   tones” (different names for the same thing).  All of these are
   basically just the difference between two frequencies.  When two
   [38]sounds are mixed in the air, the differences between the two
   “tones” causes [39]constructive and destructive interference which
   produces another tone, known as the primary [40]beat frequency.
   Mathematically it’s F[b] = |f[2] – f[1]|.  So, if you want to generate
   a specific beat frequency, it’s pretty easy to calculate using the
   equation.For example, a 50Hz tone with a [41]60Hz tone will generate
   the [42]difference tone of 10Hz (60-50).

   Anyone who has tuned an instrument has probably encountered this
   beating effect.  Many people use this effect to their advantage while
   tuning a guitar.  Fret the same note on two different strings, and then
   play both notes simultaneously.  As you tune one string closer in
   frequency to the other, you will hear the beat frequency oscillate
   slower and slower as the two tones get closer together.  When they are
   the same, the oscillation stops (there is no difference).  This is a
   great tool for tuning, as you can just listen for the beating to stop.
   You can try this on any instrument capable of variable tuning to hear
   the beating effect for yourself.

   Binaural beats are a more specific application of frequency beating.
   Instead of mixing the two tones together in the air to generate the
   difference tone; the tones are individually fed into your left and
   right ear using headphones.  As an example; your left ear is fed a 50Hz
   tone, and your right ear is fed a 60Hz tone. When mixed in the air you
   would expect a 10Hz difference tone due to the interference.  However,
   since we are feeding the tone to each ear using headphones; the
   interference is minimized.  Despite this, we still get a 10Hz
   subjective tone created in your brain or auditory system.  How exactly
   this is accomplished is an area of controversy.
   [43]4098316052 dda75b15f5 m Binaural Beats Technology

   digital-drug-binaural-beat (Photo credit: digitalbob8)

   One subtle but important point about this process is that it allows you
   to generate very low frequency beats quite easily (i.e. less than 20
   [44]Hz).  In most cases these frequencies are out of range for most
   sound reproduction systems.  So, this allows generating very low
   frequencies, using standard sound reproduction equipment.  This is
   important because the commonly known brain states operate in these low
   frequency ranges (i.e. alpha, theta, delta, beta).

   If we take binaural beats and use them to elicit a “[45]frequency
   following response” effect; we can potentially get the brain will
   follow along at or near a desired frequency.  The “frequency following
   response“, is basically the idea that when fed a specific frequency
   stimulus; your brain will tend to follow along or match the stimulating
   frequency.  So, if you feed a 10Hzdifference tone as in the examples,
   it will attempt to follow along at 10 Hz (alpha state).

   The overall idea is to get your brain to follow along at a specific
   [46]frequency range to achieve a certain state.  If you pick the
   appropriate frequency range, you can target certain well known brain
   states; such as the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Theta states.
     * Delta is 0-4 Hz and is associated with sleep.
     * Theta is 4-8Hz and is associated with meditation.
     * Alpha is 8-14Hz and is associated with relaxation.
     * Beta is 14-30Hz and is associated with alertness.

   Binaural beats can be useful for certain audio programs, where you want
   to encourage your brain into a specific brain state.  There are many
   “states” claimed; but please understand that in most cases this
   information is fairly subjective and personal.  You should keep in mind
   that everyone is different and may have a different experience.  You
   will need to relax, and be receptive to the process; generally
   improving the more you do it.

   The advantage of binaural beats is that they are fairly easy to create
   and encode directly into existing audio material, and require no
   special hardware.  This can be really useful for hypnosis [47]CDs,
   where we can try to get the user into a more receptive state during the
   Hypnosis session.

   Binaural beats are not the only way to elicit the frequency following
   response.  You can also use light stimulation.  In this technique you
   wear a pair of goggles which flash at the intended frequency.  In most
   cases these devices also generate binaural beats, synchronized with the
   light (check out the [48]Orion and [49]Proteus).  These devices contain
   various built in programs that control the flashing, modulation, and
   colors of the light and sound for a powerful combination.
