   Scientists Create New Form of Matter

   [59]Photons with strong mutual attraction in a quantum nonlinear
   medium. Image: Nature Harvard and [60]MIT scientists are challenging
   the conventional wisdom about light, and they didn't need to go to a
   galaxy far, far away to do it. Working with colleagues at the
   Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms, a group led by Harvard
   Professor of Physics Mikhail Lukin and MIT Professor of Physics Vladan
   Vuletic have managed to coax photons into binding together to form
   molecules – a state of matter that, until recently, had been purely
   theoretical. The work is described in a paper in [61]Nature.

   The discovery, Lukin says, runs contrary to decades of accepted wisdom
   about the nature of light. Photons have long been described as massless
   particles which don't interact with each other – shine two laser beams
   at each other, he says, and they simply pass through one another.

   "Photonic molecules," however, behave less like traditional lasers and
   more like something you might find in science fiction – the light
   saber.

   "Most of the properties of light we know about originate from the fact
   that photons are massless, and that they do not interact with each
   other," Lukin says. "What we have done is create a special type of
   medium in which photons interact with each other so strongly that they
   begin to act as though they have mass, and they bind together to form
   molecules. This type of photonic bound state has been discussed
   theoretically for quite a while, but until now it hadn't been observed.

   "It's not an in-apt analogy to compare this to light sabers," Lukin
   adds. "When these photons interact with each other, they're pushing
   against and deflect each other. The physics of what's happening in
   these molecules is similar to what we see in the movies."

   To get the normally-massless photons to bind to each other, Lukin and
   colleagues, including Harvard post-doctoral fellow Ofer Fisterberg,
   former Harvard doctoral student Alexey Gorshkov and MIT graduate
   students Thibault Peyronel and Qiu Liang couldn't rely on something
   like the Force – they instead turned to a set of more extreme
   conditions.

   Researchers began by pumped rubidium atoms into a vacuum chamber, then
   used lasers to cool the cloud of atoms to just a few degrees above
   absolute zero. Using extremely weak laser pulses, they then fired
   single photons into the cloud of atoms.

   As the photons enter the cloud of cold atoms, Lukin says, its energy
   excites atoms along its path, causing the photon to slow dramatically.
   As the photon moves through the cloud, that energy is handed off from
   atom to atom, and eventually exits the cloud with the photon.

   "When the photon exits the medium, its identity is preserved," Lukin
   says. "It's the same effect we see with refraction of light in a water
   glass. The light enters the water, it hands off part of its energy to
   the medium, and inside it exists as light and matter coupled together,
   but when it exits, it's still light. The process that takes place is
   the same it's just a bit more extreme – the light is slowed
   considerably, and a lot more energy is given away than during
   refraction."

   When Lukin and colleagues fired two photons into the cloud, they were
   surprised to see them exit together, as a single molecule.

   The reason they form the never-before-seen molecules?

   An effect called a Rydberg blockade, Lukin says, which states that when
   an atom is excited, nearby atoms cannot be excited to the same degree.
   In practice, the effect means that as two photons enter the atomic
   cloud, the first excites an atom, but must move forward before the
   second photon can excite nearby atoms.

   The result, he says, is that the two photons push and pull each other
   through the cloud as their energy is handed off from one atom to the
   next.

   "It's a photonic interaction that's mediated by the atomic
   interaction," Lukin says. "That makes these two photons behave like a
   molecule, and when they exit the medium they're much more likely to do
   so together than as single photons."

   While the effect is unusual, it does have some practical applications
   as well.

   "We do this for fun, and because we're pushing the frontiers of
   science," Lukin says. "But it feeds into the bigger picture of what
   we're doing because photons remain the best possible means to carry
   quantum information. The handicap, though, has been that photons don't
   interact with each other."

   To build a quantum computer, he explains, researchers need to build a
   system that can preserve quantum information, and process it using
   quantum logic operations. The challenge, however, is that quantum logic
   requires interactions between individual quanta so that quantum systems
   can be switched to perform information processing.

   "What we demonstrate with this process allows us to do that," Lukin
   says. "Before we make a useful, practical quantum switch or photonic
   logic gate we have to improve the performance, so it's still at the
   proof-of-concept level, but this is an important step. The physical
   principles we've established here are important."

   The system could even be useful in classical computing, Lukin says,
   considering the power-dissipation challenges chip-makers now face. A
   number of companies – including IBM – have worked to develop systems
   that rely on optical routers that convert light signals into electrical
   signals, but those systems face their own hurdles.

   Lukin also suggested that the system might one day even be used to
   create complex three-dimensional structures – such as crystals – wholly
   out of light.

   "What it will be useful for we don't know yet, but it's a new state of
   matter, so we are hopeful that new applications may emerge as we
   continue to investigate these photonic molecules' properties," he says.
