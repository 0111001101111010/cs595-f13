When will time travel be possible?

   Will time travel ever be possible? According to science reporter Dan
   Vergano, not likely. Although several physicists have theories. See
   more in this video response to the reader question. Send us your
   questions using #askusatoday on Twitter.

   Ever imagined some kind of future technology that would let you travel
   through time? Well technically, you already are traveling through time,
   but you'll have to settle for only moving forward at the rate you're
   going now. As Carl Sagan once put it, "If we could travel close to the
   speed of light, then we could travel further into the future in a given
   amount of time. It is one of those concepts that is profoundly
   resistant to a simple definition."

   It's no secret that being able to go back in time to correct past
   mistakes is an idea that appeals to people. Stephen Hawking showed some
   optimism when he remarked, "Time travel used to be thought of as just
   science fiction, but Einstein's general theory of relativity allows for
   the possibility that we could warp space-time so much that you could go
   off in a rocket and return before you set out." That said, Hawking and
   most other physicists also agree that traveling very far backward or
   forward in time seems unlikely. For a more detailed explanation, check
   out the video above with science reporter Dan Vergano.
