Green MP Caroline Lucas charged over fracking protest

   Caroline Lucas outside Cuadrilla's oil drilling site in Balcombe
   Caroline Lucas took part in protests in Balcombe in August

   Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas has been charged over a
   fracking protest at Balcombe in West Sussex.

   The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the Brighton Pavilion MP faced
   one count under the Public Order Act and one of obstructing a highway.

   It said it considered there was sufficient evidence and that it was in
   the public interest to prosecute.

   Ms Lucas was among about 30 protesters arrested near where energy firm
   Cuadrilla had been drilling for oil.

   She was filmed sitting in the road, alongside her son and a number of
   other protesters on 19 August.
   'In public interest'

   Ms Lucas, whose constituency is about 20 miles from the site of the
   protests, was arrested and later released on bail.

   Nigel Pilkington, a senior CPS lawyer, said: "After careful
   consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and
   that it is in the public interest to prosecute Ms Lucas for breaching a
   police order on public assemblies and wilful obstruction of the
   highway."

   Ms Lucas is due to appear at Crawley Magistrates' Court on 9 October.

   She said in a statement: "Sussex Police have today confirmed I am being
   charged with two offences arising out of my arrest in Balcombe on 19
   August.

   "I firmly believe in the right to peaceful protest and remain deeply
   concerned about the impact of fracking on climate change and the wider
   environment.

   "I have been advised by my lawyer to make no further comment at this
   stage."
