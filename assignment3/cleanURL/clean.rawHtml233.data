   This website as well as HTML5 Cart make heavy use of JavaScript, which
   is disabled in your browser. For complete experience, please, enable
   JavaScript and reload the page.

HTML5 Cart Features

Platform-independent

   HTML^5 Cart operates fully in the browser, and does not depend on the
   type of the web-server you are using.

HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Driven

   Amazingly fast and responsive. Built with best practices and latest
   development trends in mind.

Powerful Build Tools

   Each commercial [15]license of HTML^5 Cart comes with free access to
   our online state-of-the-art [16]HTML5-driven editor, which allows you
   easy creation or modification or shopping cart data files straight into
   your favorite browser. The Developer [17]license comes with powerful
   JavaScript and CSS optimization and minification tools.

Support for Different Payment Gateways

   Currently, the small business and enterprise [18]licenses come with one
   payment provider - PayPal, but we are working on support for Google
   Checkout and Amazon Payments. The basic version of HTML^5 Cart does not
   include a payment provider, but you can easily create one, using our
   API, which allows the integration of any payment provider. For more
   information about payment providers, please, check our
   [19]Documentation and API page.

Lightweight and Elegant

   The entire HTML^5 Cart (CSS, JavaScript and template files) is just
   about 40KB minified and g-zipped.

External Templates

   If you know HTML and CSS you can easily change the looks and the
   rendering of HTML^5 Cart.

International Currency Support

   HTML^5 Cart will support any currency, supported by the selected
   [20]payment provider. It will also add automatically the currency
   symbol (if available) along with the currency code.

Flexible Licenses

   We provide flexible and affordable licenses for any businesses. For
   more information, please, check our [21]licenses page.

Supported Browsers:

     * Mozilla Firefox
     * Google Chrome
     * Apple Safari
     * Opera
     * Internet Explorer 8+ (but still working with IE6/7)

Add to Cart Buttons

   If you do not want to use the "shop" mode of HTML^5 Cart, you can
   associate the items you sell on your website with our [22]add to cart
   buttons. This can done extremely easy, and any license of HTML^5 Cart
   is shipped with 5 ready to use add to cart buttons. Moreover, you can
   easily create your own buttons with CSS.

Easy to Install, Configure and Run.

   No data bases and server setup - just pure client-side implementation.
   Basically, what you need to do is adding a few JavaScript and CSS
   files, defining a few configuration properties and include your items
   to a simple JSON file. Please, check the [23]documentation for a jump
   start using HTML^5 Cart.

Modes

   HTML^5 Cart supports two operation modes - "cart" (default) and "shop".
   Please, check our [24]documentation page for more info about modes.

Localizable

   The current version of HTML^5 Cart comes with English and Bulgarian
   languages, but creating a [25]language file is a matter of minutes -
   all you have to do is to edit a simple JSON file.

Support for Multiple Data Files in Cross-platform JSON Format.

   You can have different shopping carts on a single website. Please,
   check our [26]documentation.

Themes

   The support for themes is currently under development and will be
   released soon.
