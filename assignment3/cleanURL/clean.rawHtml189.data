Mailbox.app Javascript execution

   written on Tuesday, September 24, 2013

   [9]Mailbox.app is a free email management application for iOS that
   offers very cool features to achieve Inbox Zero.

The vulnerability

   Mailbox.app up to version 1.6.2 (current version at date, Sept. 25
   2013) executes any Javascript which is present in the body of HTML
   emails.

   This is bad for security and privacy, because it allows advanced spam
   techniques, tracking of user actions, hijacking the user by just
   opening an email, and potentially much worse things, especially for
   jailbroken devices. The app also loads external images without offering
   an option to disable this behavior.

   In this very short video I demonstrate some use cases of the Javascript
   execution vulnerability on iOS. Proof of concepts are intentionally
   innocuous, such as opening apps (Music, Photos, Videos...), Facebook
   profiles, tweeting and texting an arbitrary number (user confirmation
   needed). Even if the JS code runs in a sandboxed environment and it is
   short-lived, this is not a good thing.

   Update 2013-09-25 20:00 CEST: It has come to my knowledge that the
   problem has been previously [10]reported via Twitter to Mailbox on May
   30, 2013 by [11]@bp_ . So the original credit goes to him.

   Update 2013-09-25 20:11 CEST: About 90 minutes after Ars Technica
   published [12]this, Mailbox.app representatives acknowledged the bug
   but downplayed the severity of attacks that might exploit it. A
   spokeswoman said a patch would most likely be available before the end
   of Wednesday.

   Update 2013-09-26 09:00 CEST: Mailbox published [13]this statement on
   their blog. They state:

     Today we implemented a process that strips javascript from messages
     before delivering them to mobile devices. This feature is now live
     on Mailbox servers and filtering new mail. This will be particularly
     important as we develop for other platforms, where javascript
     vulnerabilities could be more of an issue.

     As always, thanks for joining us on the road to build the world’s
     best inbox.

   While I verified that they now strip some Javascript and no longer load
   external images, I quickly found a way to bypass it, and Javascript is
   currently still executed without any user interaction. I will not
   publicly disclose details - I privately reported details to Mailbox.app
   and am waiting for a reply. now fixed.

   Update 2013-09-26 10:20 CEST: I posted a [14]comment on Ars Technica
   expressing my opinion on the impact of this vulnerability.

   Here is my comment:

     First of all I would like to thank Dan for the article, and the Ars
     community for such a great reaction. I really like this kind of
     informed and civilized discussions, and am considering to join the
     community for the near future.

     In my original report, now updated, I didn't mean to sound
     "sensational" at all, and I personally do not think this article is
     "sensational" either.

     I just highlighted that Mailbox.app blindly executes Javascript in
     HTML email bodies, and that this is bad, especially for jailbroken
     devices. I am perfectly aware of the fact vanilla iOS sandboxes
     applications, and that this limits the impact, but this should not
     excuse the design choice, which is poor from both a privacy and
     security point of view.

     Mailbox.app has gained a considerable user base, and it was not
     acceptable that it used to load external images without asking the
     user for permission and, worse, execute Javascript code, which
     allows even more information leakage.

     For unjailbroken devices, the sandboxing model, as everything where
     it comes to security, is not perfect. There is a history of sandbox
     bypass exploits. It is very likely that a vulnerability that allows
     malicious attackers to inject actual code using a Javascript vector
     inside an app to start the attack exists in current iOS versions and
     will be published in the future. After all, this has happened in the
     past. I am thinking of Pwn2Own 2010, where Vincenzo Iozzo and
     Weinmann exploited a vulnerability in MobileSafari to silently
     transmit the SMS database to a remote server, or the JailbreakMe
     "Saffron" exploit, that exploited a FreeType parsing vulnerability
     in the browser to read/write memory past buffer, bypass all
     restrictions in place in iOS and ultimately jailbreak the phone. In
     general, Javascript is used as a convenient tool for heap spraying
     attacks targeting the browser - I am not an iOS expert (my field is
     web application security), but I can't see why it should be allowed
     in a such untrusted channel as email.

     Some commenters say that this is not different from a normal webview
     or Safari itself. In my opinion, it is different because while users
     expect to execute Javascript on a webpage, they do not expect
     Javascript to be executed by simply opening emails, and emails can
     be spoofed. I'm also not aware of any other major mail app that runs
     sender-supplied JavaScript included in the body of emails.

     Mailbox.app now claims to filter JS server-side before delivering
     mails to the client. While I verified that they now strip some
     Javascript and no longer load external images, I quickly found a way
     to bypass it, and Javascript is currently still executed without any
     user interaction. I will not publicly disclose details - I privately
     reported details to Mailbox.app and am currently waiting for a
     reply.

     Have a (slightly) safer day!

   Update 2013-09-26 17:36 CEST: Mailbox support replied - they are
   working on a fix for my bypass.

   Update 2013-09-27 06:28 CEST: Mailbox support confirms the fix for the
   bypass.

     Thanks again for your email, Michele. We've updated the servers to
     also remove object tags.

     We are continually evolving how Mailbox handles messages, and
     appreciate you passing on this information.

   This vulnerability report raised some debate in the security world
   about executing Javascript in emails. Nice insight in [25]this Naked
   Security post.
