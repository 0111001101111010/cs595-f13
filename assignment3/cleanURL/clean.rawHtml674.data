   Our Work

Our Work

   With more than 400 national partners and their local affiliates,
   America's Promise Alliance is uniquely positioned to mobilize Americans
   to act. We have made a top priority of ending the high school dropout
   crisis. Our work focuses on the [26]Five Promises: Caring Adults, Safe
   Places, A Healthy Start, Effective Education, and Opportunities to Help
   Others.

Grad Nation

   Grad Nation is a large and growing movement of dedicated individuals,
   organizations and communities working together to end Americaâs dropout
   crisis. Grad Nation goals include achieving a 90 percent graduation
   rate nationwide by 2020, with no high school graduating less than 80
   percent of its students, and regaining Americaâs standing as first in
   the world in college completion.

   of Grad Nation, our campaign to end the high school dropout crisis and

Grad Nation Community Summits

   The Grad Nation Community Summits will hasten the United States’
   progress towards achieving the Grad Nation goal of a 90 percent
   national high school graduation rate by 2020. In 100 communities across
   the country, leaders from businesses, civic organizations, non-profits,
   local government, public schools, higher education, foundations and
   faith-based organizations will join with parents and young people to
   develop a blueprint to accelerate progress.

Grad Nation Communities Network

   Grad Nation Communities are at the front line of efforts to help young
   people succeed in school, work and life. They are part of an initiative
   launched in September 2011 to recognize communities across the nation
   for their efforts in support of our Grad Nation campaign. We encourage
   all communities to join us. Grad Nation Communities not only
   participate in the campaign but also benefit from it.

Youth Engagement

   Youth are an integral part of the Americaâs Promise Alliance. They
   provide fresh perspectives, energy and enthusiasm, and close
   connections with peers and young children. Across the country, young
   people are working hard to fulfill the Five Promises in many ways:
   volunteering and organizing projects; speaking up for what kids need;
   getting their friends involved.Â America's Promise values not only the
   actions of young people, but also their leadership.

   civic leaders that work together to amplify the voice of business in
   support of smart early childhood policy and programs at the state and
   federal levels. Since 2006, it has supported business coalitions in
