5 Films in the School of Terror

   Schools are wonderful places to set horror films.  Plenty of different
   people, lots of rooms and usually have a shop room with tons of
   potential weapons.  In high schools you can have your killer or killers
   fighting for identity or revenge for being persecuted or left of others
   reindeer games.  With such a tight knit community, rumours and heresy
   can create terrific red herring opportunities and can mask your
   otherwise obvious psychopath.  In college, it's the opposite, where
   your killers can be the guy/girl next to you but you've been so bogged
   down on work that you haven't had a chance to meet.  Large classrooms
   and huge institutions create anonymity for your antagonist and you can
   even create backgrounds that begin to boil in high school, have them
   over flow, when they meet your protagonist in college or university.
   With that in mind here are 5 Films in the School of Terror:
   5. The Dorm That Drips Blood (aka Pranks) (1982) - Joanne and her
   friends, Patty, Craig and Debbie are spending their Christmas break
   clearing out the dorms that are being demolished in a few weeks.
   Joanne's boyfriend Tim is going skiing but luckily there is a hunky
   replacement for Joanne in the way of Brian.  So they start working on
   the dorms when they realized that not all the students have left the
   dorm area.  That creepy kid, John Hemmit is still lurking about the
   campus and now things are disappearing! Dinners are being ruined and
   bodies are popping up! Can Joanne keep her team alive, finish clearing
   out the old dorms, deal with Tim and still have time to find the real
   meaning of Christmas?  The film is OK, some things seem to drag on but
   the gore scenes are pretty decent.  There's a part with a drill that's
   enjoyable and that's probably what got them on the Video Nasties list.
   Acting wise, no one really went anywhere after film this except for
   Daphne Zuniga (Spaceballs, The Sure Thing, Melrose Place) and one of
   directors, Stephen Carpenter is writing for Grimm.  The film can be
   enjoyable at times but it wouldn't be the first one on my list.  Oh
   shit, it is.

   4. Night School (aka Terror Eyes) (1981) - Teacher's aide Ann Barron is
   just sending the last kid home for daycare on the darkest 6:00 pm, I've
   every seen.  Just before getting off the playground carousel, she is
   confronted by a person in a motorcycle helmet and black leather
   jacket.  This person mercilessly starts spinning Ann on the playground
   carousel at speeds unknown by man, somehow not allowing Ann to simply
   walk away.  Eventually after all the spinning Ann is decapitated.  The
   next day the police show up and find her head in a bucket of water,
   lead detective Judd Austin soon discovers that Ann was going to night
   school at Wendell College.  Judd heads over to the school and speaks
   with Ann's friend Kim, who says that Ann was depressed because she was
   dating a married man but didn't know who it was.  Judd visits the
   snooty, Professor Millet and meets his research assistant/Student
   Eleanor.   They tell him nothing.  Eleanor leaves and is followed by a
   creepy busboy named Gus.  She freaks out and runs home and surprise her
   boyfriend is Professor Millet! They have some weird blood sexy time in
   the tub and then we get back to the movie.  Ann's friend Kim gets axed
   and Judd thinks there is a connection to the school.  More heads pop
   up, so Judd and his partner Taj better to find out who's doing the
   chopping.  I really like the idea of this film and when it comes
   together at the end, it would be a nice twist but there was so much
   shit that I wasn't crazy about.  I did like the decapitation scenes,
   even though they weren't that gory and I like the scene in the
   restaurant, when you thought people were eating a soup with a head in
   it.  That was enjoyable but the cops were morons and I don't understand
   how people couldn't get away from this killer.  Maybe I missed
   something, this was another film on the Nasties list but this was
   pretty low key unless they felt bad for Rachel Ward. The killer is
   scary in their motorcycle gear but it seems like a lot of shit you have
   to wade through to get there.

   3. Satan's School for Girls (1973) -When Elizabeth Sayers gets home,
   she discovers that her younger sister, Martha as locked herself in her
   home and has hung herself. Good to see you too!  The police believe
   that it's a suicide but Elizabeth has a feeling that there is something
   more to it. The police wish her luck with that and Elizabeth tracks
   down one of Martha's old classmates, Lucy Dembrow.  Lucy tries to be
   polite with Elizabeth but something slips in the conversation and
   Elizabeth thinks that the school is involved somehow.  Elizabeth
   decides it's time to go under cover and heads out to The Salem Academy
   of Women to pose as a student.  Under the name Elizabeth Morgan, she is
   greeted by Roberta, Debbie and Jody and become instant friends!
   Elizabeth learns that the dean is old and considered a "Dragonlady"
   from her new friends and gets the nickel tour around the campus.  She
   meets the dean, is given her class list and heads to her first class
   which is art with the resident hot male teacher, Dr. Joseph Clampett.
   They judge the classes art, as they rightfully should, and Elizabeth
   discovers Debbie as painted a picture of her sister Martha screaming in
   a mysterious room.  When asked about it, Debbie said she knew Martha
   but couldn't remember the room that she was in and they head to the
   next class, where Professor Delacroix is torturing mice by putting them
   in a maze and not feeding them. Great class!  Delacroix ends up
   comparing Debbie with the mice and she ends up having a fainting
   spell.  A few hours later, she doesn't remember anything and is ready
   to party at Dr. Clampett's!  During the party, Jody bursts in and tells
   everyone that Lucy Dembrow as committed suicide! dun dun Dunnnnnnnn!
   Now Elizabeth with her new besties must find out what the connection is
   with these suicides, that room and what the hell is going on at that
   school! Like any Spelling production, lots of pretty ladies and little
   on actual story.  What I like about this film is that it brings Satan
   back into the picture and they are bringing old school elements that
   are lacking in some of today's horror. Good cast Jo Van Fleet as the
   Head mistress, Kate Jackson, Cheryl Stoopelmoor (Cheryl Ladd) and
   Pamela Franklin (Flora from the Innocents).  It's dumb in a PG satan
   kind of story but it's still fun to watch and get caught up in the
   mystery.

   2. Heathers (1988) - Veronica hates her friends and her life.  She is
   caught up with the most popular clique in school, the Heathers, which
   consist of 3 girls named Heather who are mean and shallow.  During
   lunch Veronica meets a Jason Dean (J.D), a new student, who just moved
   from Texas.  They instantly hit it off but unfortunately, she is being
   forced to go college party with the head Heather.  After almost being
   date raped and puking her guts out at the party, the furious Heather
   tells her that her social life is over.  She is going to tell everyone
   in school about the barfing situation and she will no longer be cool.
   Veronica goes home and J.D shows up at her window and after little
   evening delight, decide to teach Heather a lesson in humility in the
   morning.  They go over to her house, joke about poisoning Heather
   instead of just grossing her out and Veronica grabs the wrong cup. They
   accidentally end up killing Heather.  Oops.... They panic and decide to
   make it look like a suicide, Veronica writes a dramatic note and they
   skedaddle out of there.  On Monday, the whole school is in shock and no
   one can believe that Heather wasn't the stuck up bitch everyone thought
   she was but a misunderstood beauty who was overcome by the pressures of
   school and society.  After the funeral, Heather number 2 begs Veronica
   to come on a double date with the school's popular jocks, Kurt and
   Ram.  Veronica caves in and spends an evening tipping cows, fending off
   drunk groping and eventually leaving with J.D after her date passes out
   in cowshit.  The next day is filled Kurt fills the school with sex
   rumours about him, Veronica and Kurt.  She and J.D plan a prank to get
   them back, however the prank goes horribly wrong and they end up
   killing them.  Now, her and J.D have committed three murders and she is
   starting to wonder if these were really accidents and is this the guy,
   J.D right for me? Love this movie when I was a teen and I think it
   still holds up.  Although deemed a comedy, I think this film fits
   nicely with the current blog.  We have a psychotic guy killing people
   and in the end wants to blow up the school. This film is a 80's version
   of Massacre at Central High with more laughs.  Brillaint cast with
   Christian Slater and Winona Ryder are at their peak and Shannon Doherty
   here right before she broke out on 90210.  Funny script, clean killings
   and tons of fun.  Must watch for any teen trying to survive high
   school.

   1. Class of 1984 (1982) - It's Andrew Norris's first day of teaching
   school at an inner city school in the big city.  He notices one of his
   colleagues, Terry Corrigan loading a gun and asks Terry, if it was
   really necessary. Terry tells him that he'll see.  As they are ushered
   through the metal detectors in the front, Mr. Norris heads to his music
   class where he is first confronted with Peter Stegman and his gang.  He
   asks them to leave because they are being disruptive and Stegman
   threatens Norris.  Once they've left Norris focuses on the rest of the
   class and becomes friends with to of his new students Arthur and
   Deneen.  As the school year goes on, Mr. Norris notices Stegman and his
   crew run the school using violence and drugs and after a student dies
   from taking some Angel dust, Norris vows to stop Stegman at any costs
   to him and his family! However, Stegman and his gang aren't going to
   call it quits without a fight.  Fantastic cast, Michale J. Fox, Roddy
   McDowell, Al Waxman! After this film Mark L. Lester went on to direct
   Firestarter, Commando and other great 80's films.  What I love about
   the film is that it's Mr. Norris that keeps upping the ante. For a
   protagonist, he does a lot of antagonistic things to have this gang
   really start attacking him and his wife.  Lester does a nice job
   building the tension and it when it comes to the end of the film all
   bets are off on both sides.  Also, the film has a terrific soundtrack
   with Alice Cooper, Teenage Head and Fear.
   [EMBED]
   Each of these films have different elements that make a great horror
   films and they used in the school context.  Whether it's alone in the
   school, a supernatural entity causing you pain or a group of bullies,
   these films show you that education can be scary and it's even more
   terrifying when you have a maniac with an axe chasing you!

       Did you see Detention yet? A lot of fun but, DAMN, it throws in
       everything bar the kitchen sink and kinda feels like a full on
       assualt of references and sly nods to all kinds of movies.

            Sorry, this took so long. I did see it, but unfortunately I
            wasn't that crazy about it. The references drove me bananas
            that I had to walk out, while the encode was going on. It's
            unfortunate it because the director did some interesting
            things and the story was amusing but when they started
            talking, it drove me up the wall. Like listening to a drunk
            Dennis Miller, who just had a lobotomy and believed he was
            still in the early 90's. I think it's one of those kind of
            films, where you either love it or you hate it and
            unfortunately, I'm the latter.
