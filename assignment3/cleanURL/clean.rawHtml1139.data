   Dear Friend,

   Are you planning on starting your own photo business right now or in
   the near future?  If so, pay attention!

   your face, then this book is definitely for YOU!

   I discovered finding information about the many different photo
   business models all in one place is difficult.  And I got tired of
   spending a fortune on LOTS of different books and courses to learn
   about each kind of photo specialty only to discover I'd spent my
   hard-earned money on one that really wouldn't  work for me. So I'd move
   on to the next idea, and nope, that wasn't it either.  Man, a lot of
   money flew out of my bank account in a hurry while I tried to find just
   the right photography niche for me!  That's why I decided to create a
