Malicious browser extensions pose a serious threat and defenses are lacking

Many security products offer inadequate protection against malicious browser
extensions, a researcher has found

   By Lucian Constantin
   September 26, 2013 08:44 AM ET

   IDG News Service - The number of malicious browser extensions has
   significantly increased in the past year but  many security products
   fail to offer adequate protection against them, while others are simply
   not designed to do so, according to a security researcher.

   Attackers have already used such extensions to perform click fraud by
   inserting rogue advertisements into websites or by hijacking search
   queries, but research has shown that this type of malware has the
   potential to cause much more damage.

   Last year Zoltan Balazs, an IT security consultant with professional
   services firm Deloitte in Hungary, [87]created a proof-of-concept
   malicious extension that could be controlled remotely by an attacker
   and could steal authentication credentials, hijack accounts, modify
   locally displayed Web pages, take screenshots through the computer's
   webcam, bypass two-factor authentication systems and even download and
   execute malicious files on a victim's computer.

   And last week the European Union Agency for Network and Information
   Security (ENISA) [88]warned in its midyear report: "An increase in
   malicious browser extensions has been registered, aimed at taking over
   social network accounts."

   Earlier this year Balazs investigated how various security products
   protect users against malicious browser extensions and presented his
   findings at the OHM2013 security conference near Amsterdam in August.
   He performed tests against browser security extensions, sandboxing
   software, Internet security suites, anti-keylogging applications and
   financial fraud prevention programs recommended by some banks.

   Many of these products either don't detect and block malicious
   extensions at all, or their protection can be bypassed, sometimes very
   easily, he found.

   Not all of the tested products claim to protect against malicious
   extensions, but Balazs said he tested them because some users might
   believe they do.

   For example, the NoScript security extension for Mozilla Firefox is
   designed to block plug-in content from executing without user
   authorization, and also blocks some Web-based attacks such as
   cross-site scripting or clickjacking. However, it doesn't protect
   against malicious browser extensions or local malware, Balazs said.

   BrowserProtect, another Firefox extension, claims to protect the
   browser against "homepage, search provider, extension, add-on, BHO and
   other hijacks." This extension also fails to protect against malicious
   extensions, the researcher said.

   Browser security extensions are not really trying to protect against
   malicious extensions and they wouldn't be able to because by design
   they run with the same privileges as those extensions, Balazs said.

   Balazs also tested Internet security suites from five top antivirus
   vendors that he declined to name. The level of protection they offered
   against malicious browser extensions varied from none to good.

   One of the tested products detected and removed the researcher's
   malicious Firefox extension, but he was able to bypass the detection
   signature by adding a single space character at a specific location in
   the extension's code.
