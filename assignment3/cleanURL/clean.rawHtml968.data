   Imagine your food was able to play with cutlery and dance around in
   your mouth. That's designer [21]Minsu Kim 's goal. Through Living Food
   — a project which she developed while attending the Royal College of
   Art in London — the artist builds on synthetic biology to create meals
   that act like living, breathing creatures. So far, Kim has prepared
   three dishes, each exhibiting different qualities: wriggling around,
   waving tentacles or puffing up as though breathing.

   "Synthetic biotech has already started to create artificial life in
   organic forms," says the designer. "Breathing life into artificial
   digestible forms is not merely a fantasy."

   Check out the video and photos below try to wrap your head around her
   creations!
