   By Jack Hollingsworth

   Free, online courses available to the public, known as massive open
   online courses (MOOCs) have taken higher education by storm, as online
   consortium [57]edX announced this month that it would [58]partner with
   Google to make these online courses accessible to more students than
   ever.

   But studies on MOOCs’ effectiveness are limited, if not discouraging,
   and students who have taken the courses have been left divided on how
   valuable they are.

   Without professors marking attendance, grades recorded on transcripts
   or live discussions, MOOCs present a formidable challenge to those
   looking to complete them, students said.

   “I think there’s a type of person who could do well in a MOOC: someone
   who is really, really motivated and excited about learning for the sake
   of learning. But for me — and it sounds really bad — I go to class for
   a lot of reasons, but not because of a joy for learning,” says Morgan
   Bookheimer, a student completing a master’s of science in nutrition and
   public health at Teachers College at Columbia University.

   Bookheimer is taking a six-month-long MOOC on human physiology offered
   by the University of California-Berkeley as a prerequisite for her
   upperlevel courses at Teachers College.

   Given that the topic is not her favorite and that it is the students’
   responsibility to complete readings and assignments on time, Bookheimer
   is skeptical that she will learn the material.

   “I don’t think I’d take one again,” Bookheimer says, adding that she
   was currently in the process of completing her first assignment — one
   that she had been given months to finish — on the eve of its deadline.
   “It’s difficult to stay motivated when the format of the course is,
   ‘Here’s the reading. Now do the assignment.’ I feel like that works in
   the classroom, but not online.”

   Lee Gao, a senior studying computer science at Cornell University, had
   a similar experience with MOOCs, finding them difficult to complete
   without the external motivation of a physical classroom.

   In his case, it was not a requirement that made him enroll in a MOOC;
   Gao says he was struggling with his classes his sophomore year and
   decided to enroll in a couple of MOOCs to supplement his classroom
   learning.

   “I was like, ‘Wow, they’re offering free courses? This is perfect,’ ”
   he says.

   But soon, reality caught up. Gao said he found allocating time to
   sitting down and watching lectures online tedious. Even the fact that
   his assignments were graded did little to motivate him, because he knew
   that, if he did well, he would be the only person who would know it.

   “Eventually, I dropped all but one of the MOOCs,” Gao says.

   Would he do it again?

   “Honestly? Probably not,” Gao says.

   Even though his courses at Cornell University are mostly large lectures
   that offer little opportunity to get to know professors, Gao says he
   still feels that “the importance of your grade or your work feels
   diluted” with a MOOC.

   “I feel absolutely no obligation to do well in a MOOC,” he says. “(In
   contrast,) if I get a terrible grade here, I’d feel really bad about
   disappointing the professor.”

   Intrinsic motivation is the biggest factor behind how likely a student
   might be to complete a MOOC, says Jess Reif, a senior studying
   industrial and labor relations at Cornell who has completed a
   statistics MOOC.

   Even with the challenge she found in keeping on top of her MOOC
   coursework, Reif says she would not hesitate to take another one again.
   These free, online courses also offer universities the potential to
   increase access to education in corners of the world where resources
   are scarce, Reif adds.

   “I think it’s a great way to gain exposure to an area that you might
   not be able to take at your college,” she says.
