More blacks, Hispanics get SAT scores predicting college success

   Latest national results on the SAT show a rising number of black and
   Hispanic students with scores that indicate likely success in college,
   test officials announced Thursday.

   College Board, the Manhattan-based not-for-profit organization that
   sponsors the SAT, uses a benchmark score of 1550 out of a possible 2400
   on the exam's three sections, because that figure is associated with a
   strong probability that students will earn at least B-minus averages
   during their first year in college.

   This year's results showed 15.6 percent of African-Americans taking the
   test met or exceeded the benchmark score, compared with 14.8 percent in
   2012. Among Hispanic students, 23.5 percent met or exceeded the
   benchmark, up from 22.8 percent last year.

   Overall, average scores of test-takers in the Class of 2013 plateaued,
   and so did the percentage of high school graduates deemed well-prepared
   for college, the test's sponsor said. The percentage of those meeting
   or exceeding the benchmark remained at 43 percent, the same as in 2011
   and 2012.

   The test, the college admissions exam most often used in New York
   State, was taken by about 1.66 million students worldwide in the 2013
   graduating class. The number of test-takers was down from the previous
   year, prompting critics of the SAT to speculate that more students are
   opting for the rival ACT entrance exam.

   Cyndie Schmeiser, College Board's chief of assessment, deplored what
   she called the "frozen" overall scores, which are reflected in results
   from other national testing programs as well.

   Critics of the SAT, including many social activists, contend that test
   scores correlate closely with family incomes and show that students
   with enough money to hire test-prep tutors hold a substantial
   advantage.

   College Board officials, at a news conference, pointed to improved
   results among minority students as a hopeful sign.

   They noted the organization's initiative to waive $51 individual SAT
   fees for growing numbers of low-income students. For this year's
   college-bound test-takers, 23 percent obtained waivers, up from 17
   percent five years ago.

   David Coleman, the College Board president, said that in January he
   will reveal details of a major revision of the SAT. Coleman announced
   the makeover in February but provided no timetable then.

   The SAT is divided into sections for critical reading, writing and
   math. Each section is scored on a scale of 200 to 800.

   Average scores nationwide for 2013 remained the same as last year's on
   all three sections -- 496 in reading, 488 in writing and 514 in math.

   For New York State, this year's average reading scores rose to 485,
   from 483 last year. Writing scores also rose two points, to 477, while
   math scores rose one point, to 501.

   Thursday's announcement that national SAT scores remained flat prompted
   critics to renew their longtime contention that federal testing
   policies have failed. SAT reading scores are 10 points lower now than
   in 2001, when then-President George W. Bush signed the "No Child Left
   Behind" law that increased testing requirements nationwide.

   Bob Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a nonprofit
   advocacy group, said the latest SAT results showed the "total failure"
   of intensified testing to boost students' readiness for college.
