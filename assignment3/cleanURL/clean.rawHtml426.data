[11]Comparing the HTML with POML (for Purchase order markup language)

   HyperText Markup Language
   by [13]Abode of Chaos

   Comparing the HTML with POML (for Purchase order markup language)

   With a little work you could probably get code to associate each header
   name with its given column this is meaning that you impose upon the
   table by all rights the columns could in fact have no association with
   the column headers in this organization. Suppose however that you could
   create your own HTML to deal with this problem substituting purchase
   order for table line item and then labeling each element with the name
   of the property it contains. Comparing the HTML with POML (for Purchase
   order markup language) the difference that such a name change makes is
   dramatic. Just at a glance you can tell that a purchase order is
   comprised of line items which in turn include names codes unit costs
   and number of units. You can intuit the purpose of the table and a
   largely anonymous table suddenly becomes a very clear object model.

   The purchase order Markup Language is of course actually an instance of
   XML and therein lies the irony. SGML has always had the data
   structuring capability but given the complexity of both the tools and
   the language itself using SGML as a data description language was
   simply not cost-effective. However by cutting out a significant part of
   the overhead that SGML represents, the whole notion that a document is
   simply one from a data structure quickly emerges. This realization
   didn’t bypass programmers. Most programming language have basic data
   structure that are built in to the language-linked, lists, vectors,
   collections- but these are for the most part linear structures. One
   structure in particular, the associative array does let you associate a
   label with a given entity in a list and if that entity itself  as an
   associative array then you can build a structure similar to what XML
   offers. (And in some language XML parsers are built in precisely this
   manner.)

   However wrapping your brain around XSL can take a little bit of work.
   XSL is built around the notion of templates. Each template provides a
   pattern to match and when an XML element matches the pattern the
   templates is run generating text that is added to a growing string of
   text. The XSL parser travels down the original XML document an element
   at a time opening up child elements before going to the next sibling
   element. Put another way XSL works recursively so that an XSL document
   can be remarkably compact compared to the more linear forms of
   procedural languages. Of course, XSL can also get considerably more
   cryptic for precisely the same reason.  A Simple XSL script can convert
   the purchase order into a table for output as demonstrated by the
   example. The gist of preceding code can be seen by realizing that there
   are four templates. The first matching the top most element in the XSL
   structure. The second matching purchases order. The third designed to
   trap line items. The fourth writing out each of the line item
   properties. The apply templates statement essentially instructs the XSL
   parser to run any applicable templates against the children or other
   descendents of the current elements.
