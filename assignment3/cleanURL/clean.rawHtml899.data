   Late one night in the fall of 2005, Mark Zuckerberg was showing me
   around his crappy little apartment in Palo Alto, California.
   [49]Facebook, the company he’d founded the year before in his Harvard
   dorm room, was in its infancy, and the slight 21-year-old, dressed in
   jeans and a Patagonia hoodie, still lived like an undergraduate. There
   was just a mattress on the floor, 10 pairs of Adidas sandals in the
   closet and an electric guitar leaning against a bare wall. “I don’t
   even think the shower has a shower curtain,” he said with a shrug.

   Although the moguls of Silicon Valley were already courting him,
   Zuckerberg seemed genuinely uninterested in cashing in. He had started
   his career as a hacker, busting into Harvard’s online student database
   to create a better way for people to keep track of their friends—an
   online face-book of his own. (“Let the hacking begin,” he famously
   blogged that night.) As he brewed a pot of green tea in his kitchenette
   during my visit, he still lived by those words. “I just want to build
   something cool,” he told me. And so he did.

   For the past two decades, I’ve traveled the world for publications
   including Rolling Stone, The New Yorker and Playboy to find and write
   about the most innovative people online. Most had begun as hackers.
   Often they were in the early stages of their careers. Some became
   billionaires (like Zuckerberg, two years after we met). Some became
   prisoners ([50]WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange). Others remained
   unknown (the hacker collective Anonymous). Dozens crashed and burned.

   [253338_main.jpg]

   But as I’ve observed firsthand, a singular obsession drives this
   generation of hackers, gamers, activists and geeks: building access to
   information and one another, even if it means breaking something old—or
   the law. Their work has turned the web into a kind of Wild West—a
   no-holds-barred fight over freedom and information that reached a fever
   pitch this year. Whether these “hacktivists” end up loved, hated,
   feared, politically exiled (as in the case of “traitor” National
   Security Agency hacker Edward Snowden) or even dead (Aaron Swartz and
   Barnaby Jack, both master hackers who died this year), there’s one
   crucial legacy they all share.

   The internet would suck without them.

   If you want to understand why the world needs hackers, you have to
   start with games. I first learned this one afternoon in the early
   1980s. I was around 13 and, like many guys my age, blew my time and my
   lawn money on video games. In Tampa that meant biking down to ShowBiz
   Pizza, a strip mall restaurant that had all the latest arcade games:
   Donkey Kong, Defender, Spy Hunter and the rest. Although we all had
   Atari 2600s at home, we preferred to get our game on away from our
   parents. Arcades were our secret frats, places to wiggle our joysticks,
   curse and get high.

   But one day we discovered that ShowBiz was a place for something else
   too: hacking. The arcade had just gotten a few personal computers,
   technology that was emerging at the time. For a couple of tokens you
   could sit at the machines and play some rudimentary computer games. You
   could also type in words and listen to the computer read them back to
   you. It took about three seconds for us to type “Fuck the manager,” but
   some kind of security program prevented the machines from saying
   profanities. With a little experimentation, however, we realized that
   “Phuck the manager” circumvented the restrictions—until the old guy
   chased us out the door.

   That discovery taught us something important: You don’t have to be a
   programmer to know how to hack. Hacking isn’t really about coding. It’s
   about questioning and modifying a system, whether that system is a
   computer or a way of life. Yes, we were young punks at ShowBiz, and it
   sucked to get booted from the place. But our little hack was a good
   thing for one fundamental reason: It questioned a system and exposed a
   vulnerability. We wanted more freedom, more access, and we figured out
   how to get it. Little did we know there was a generation of kids like
   us seeking freedom with new technology, and by hacking games, they were
   paving the way for the digital revolution to come.

   [253339_main.jpg]

   I met two of the most important ones 15 years later when I was writing
   my book Masters of Doom, about the ultraviolent shooter franchises Doom
   and Quake. Co-founders John Carmack and John Romero, also known as the
   Two Johns, had grown up in arcades as we had and were considerably more
   skilled as hackers. They got their break by hacking their own version
   of Super Mario Bros. 3 on a PC—an astonishing feat at the time—and
   building around it one of the most successful game companies ever, id
   Software.

   Instead of building games that prevented hackers from messing with
   their code, Carmack, the lead programmer, specifically designed his
   games so they would be easier to hack. With a little time and will an
   industrious player could, say, tweak the code in Doom to make an entire
   level of the game’s playing world look like the Millennium Falcon
   instead of an underground labyrinth. The internet of the mid-1990s
   began to teem with modified versions—or “mods”—of Doom and Quake,
   giving rise to a subculture of hackers who would later make some of
   today’s biggest game franchises, from Halo to Gears of War.

   The Two Johns understood an essential tenet of the nascent digital age:
   By breaking systems and building something new, hackers developed the
   skill and passion for driving innovation. As Carmack explains in
   Masters of Doom, “In the information age, the barriers just aren’t
   there. The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go
   develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of
   capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your
   refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on and the dedication to go through
   with it.”

                                     •

   In the early days of the internet, anyone with a modem and a computer
   could freely exchange information with others. Deadheads swapped music.
   College students traded games. Scientists shared research. Prescient
   geeks knew it was only a matter of time before commercial interests
   invaded the space, and early freedom fighters took up the cause.
