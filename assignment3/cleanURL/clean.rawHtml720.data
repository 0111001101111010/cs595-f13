[6]This is fun: What it means to deploy

   [7]September 30, 2013 [8]Derek Hopper

   Releasing new code is extremely fun. Never take it for granted. The
   moment you're bored shipping new code is the moment you should consider
   finding a new gig.

   Here's why:
    1. Shipping new code means people can use and see it immediately.
    2. Each time you deploy, you're shipping a NEW VERSION.
    3. You get emails thanking you.
    4. People notice.
    5. If you break something, you'll know.

People thank you for your work.

   This is motivation alone. Your entire team, the people that
   brainstormed, planned, designed, implemented, and shipped that new
   version - you get to be thanked by people who love what you do. Every
   day.

   Never take that for granted.

   What else can you be doing where this happens? Garbage men don't get
   thanked every day (although they should). The mailman surely doesn't
   get thanked every day (although he should).

   Realize what you do is powerful. You're inspiring people. They care
   about what you do.

   You might be making their business better. Maybe, you're the
   entertainment in that person's life. You might even be helping them
   through a tough time.

   Just realize you're communicating to people. You may never meet them.
   You may never say a word to them. But they're thinking about you.
   Trust me.

[10]Handling subdomains for Rails in your development environment

   [11]September 23, 2013 [12]Derek Hopper

   We built Tula with subdomains from the beginning, so we needed a nice
   way to handle subdomains in our development environments. We used pow
   for some time, but that wasn't the perfect solution for me. That's
   because I wanted a few things out of a solution:
     * Configure it once and forget about it
     * Know exactly when my server was started and stopped
     * Use whatever I wanted as an app server i.e. unicorn

   It took us awhile to settle on this solution, so here it is. It uses a
   combination of Apache (or nginx) and dnsmasq which I've become a huge
   fan of.

   The first part is simple. You'll want to install and use dnsmasq. It's
   a nice, lightweight and local DNS provider that will run on your
   machine. You can serve the names of local machines which are not part
   of the global DNS.

   It's easy to install on both Linux and Mac.
# On Ubuntu Linux
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
# On Mac with Homebrew
brew install dnsmasq

   Once installed, you'll want to add the following to your dnsmasq.conf
   file. This will resolve any domain with a TLD of .dev to your local
   machine. This is handy if you have a lot of projects (Rails or
   otherwise) in the same directory.

   Next, you'll want to configure Apache (or nginx) as the following. The
   key for Apache is VirtualDocumentRoot. It allows you to set the
   document root based on various parts of the domain name. In this case,
   I've taken the main part of the domain name as the document root. The
   domain name will resolve to a project in my Projects directory. This
   will always work if I continue to use my Projects directory for Rails
   projects.

   If you set this up once for your Rails projects, you'll never have to
   worry about adding anything to your hosts file, nor will you have to
   worry about port numbers. It's all taken care of for you.  You can
   access your subdomains as you would normally. It's important to note
   that unicorn is running on port 5000 in this example.

[14]My tmux configuration with tmuxinator

   [15]September 20, 2013 [16]Derek Hopper

   We're a small, remote engineering team (only 3 people), so we haven't
   developed a standard for our development machines yet.  We have 1
   person on Mac, 1 person on Ubuntu (me), and 1 person on Manjaro
   (Linux).

   We're always experimenting with new tools and adding new ones to our
   toolbox. The one I want to talk about today is [17]tmuxinator.

   If you're familiar with tmux, it can be a bit of a pain to script your
   tmux sessions. For example, if you want one pane to run vim, another to
   show a log file, and a third to run the rails console, it takes a bit
   of time to script.

   The goal is this: When I turn on my machine in the morning, I want to
   type one command to do the following:
     * Start vim in the right directory.
     * Give myself a command prompt in the right project directory.
     * Start the Rails server.
     * Start a tail of the development log.
     * Start the Rails console.
     * Start spork for running specs.

   You can easily script all of this with [18]tmuxinator.


   Using the script above, you end up with a tmux layout like so.
   tmuxinator.png tmuxinator.png

   When I start my terminal for the day, I run the command mux tula   and
   I'm off and running. A tmux session is started and I end up with the
   following:
     * vim running in the top window
     * a prompt on the bottom for playing with git, bundle, etc.
     * the Rails server running on window 1
     * the development log tail on window 2
     * a Rails console on window 3

   You're up and running for development in no time.

   As a bonus if you work on multiple projects, simply detach from this
   tmux session and run another. Your session is saved (until you restart
   your computer), so switching between projects is a breeze.

   I haven't played much with this layout and I'm sure it's not perfect.
   It's a much better solution to what I was doing in a previous life. If
   you have any of your own tmux layouts, I'd love to hear from you in the
   comments below.

   And, by the way, if you need a great tmux primer, I recommend  [19]TMUX
   – The Terminal Multiplexer.

[26]Make your Rails views easy with select

   [27]September 6, 2013 [28]Derek Hopper

   Recently, we were writing a new report for [29]Tula. We needed to query
   for all users that had purchased a particular pass and when they
   purchased it.

   Here's what we came up with first:

   Well, that doesn't make it very easy to display in our view. We want a
   view as simple as this:

   Now that we had the simple view code with our favorite interface, we
   had to implement that interface. How would we do that? (By the way, you
   may notice we have date formatting in our view. You may want to try a
   [30]decorator so your view is even simpler.)

   By adding a select to our query, we can select all of the user
   attributes AND the pass attributes we need. We can add these attributes
   to the user (if you're familiar with SQL, we're essentially merging the
   join table attributes with the user being returned). You might want to
   read more about [31]selecting specific fields.


   Now, we've got a nice interface to work with that keeps our view super
   simple and not doing any extra work. We can access pass_name
   and pass_purchase_date  directly from the user.

   You should notice that we have a query in the controller. For
   simplicity, I kept it in the controller. You should really have this
   query in your model or better yet, in a single responsibility [32]query
   object (see #4).

   If you have any questions or comments, please let us know in the
   comments section below.

[34]Your code sucks, mine is better, and why code review doesn't have to be
painful

   [35]August 7, 2013 [36]Derek Hopper

   We've been experimenting with different ways to make code review part
   of our culture. Although we'd like to, we don't pair program regularly
   for a variety of reasons. We're a remote team in 6 different time zones
   and we currently have 4 different projects for only 3 engineers. As a
   result, we try to keep context switching to a minimum, but code review
   naturally drives context switching for us.

     Code review is a great way to improve code quality!

   Well, that's great, but how do you do it?  We set out to seek an answer
   to that question.

   First of all, it's important to realize that all organizations are
   different. The people are different, the projects are different, the
   tools are different, etc. Sure, many of us share similarities, but for
   the most part, everything is slightly different. Although you can read
   and read about how other organizations do it, you have to find your own
   way through your own experimentation.

   Experimentation is fun. If we find a new tool we'd like to use or a new
   idea we'd like to add to our workflow, we try it. We don't have a
   formal experimentation period. We just try it. If we like it, we find a
   way to keep it. If we don't like it, we throw it out.

   For example, we recently wanted to try [38]Blossom. Up until that
   point, we were exclusive to [39]Basecamp for project planning. We knew
   Basecamp was missing something, but transitioning clients to Basecamp
   has been pretty easy. Blossom has started to fill the hole in our
   hearts and we've decided to keep it. A word of warning though: some of
   your clients won't love your tools as much as you do. Not all of our
   clients liked Blossom.

   Like Blossom, code review is a specific piece of our workflow we're
   actively experimenting with.  We've tried a few different things so
   far, and we haven't been completely satisfied yet. That doesn't mean
   we've given up. We're just adapting and changing our experiments to
   make us happy.

   Experiment #1  - Code reviews live on GitHub

   This is obvious. All of our code is on GitHub. Their collaboration
   tools and commenting system is easy and if you've worked on open
   source, it's pretty easy to work with. We can review the code and
   comment inline on the lines of code in question. We can open up issues
   when we see them and suggest ways to refactor.

   Long ago when we first started doing this, we knew it was a success
   right at the start. To improve quality, this was definitely a win.

   One of the advantages of using GitHub for your code reviews is the rich
   history. If you're constantly talking about your code and using pull
   requests to signal when code gets merged, you'll have a rich history of
   discussions, bug fixes, and screenshots. If you practice continuous
   deployment, you'll have a history of deployments as well.

   History is invaluable. You'll be able to answer questions like, "why
   did we do it this way?" You'll be able to see screenshots of the app as
   its being built. The history will serve as a seed to help you recall
   much more about the code written.

   Although reviewing code on GitHub is great, code review comes with a
   price. We're a distributed team and sometimes only one engineer is
   online. How do you practice code review if you value the speed at which
   you execute? This was one of the problems. If we wanted to integrate
   code review into our organization, how do we do it in these cases? Do
   we sit and wait until another engineer comes online? This was a problem
   we didn't know how to address.

   Experiment #2 - Assigning a code review todo on Basecamp

   Reviewing code on GitHub was definitely becoming part of our
   organization; however, we wanted to make sure we were doing it. Since
   we were using Basecamp at the time, we decided it was a good idea to
   create a todo on Basecamp and assign it to someone for code review.
   That person would be notified and they would review it, right?

   Much like Experiment #1, we still needed someone to be online. If one
   of our engineers completed a bug fix and no other engineers were
   online, what happens? The todo gets created and the code sits there
   until that person gets online.

   Another problem for us was context switching. If someone was online,
   should they immediately switch and do a code review? It doesn't seem
   like a good idea, does it?

   Experiment #3 - Added a code review step in Blossom

   As we started to use Blossom, we started to ditch our usage of
   Basecamp. We setup our [40]kanban flow and decided to add a code review
   stage. It seemed like a code review stage was just what we needed.

   We placed our code review stage after our QA stage (we're big fans of
   having a QA person to test the code as a user).  Over time, we started
   to see quite a bit of friction in our workflow. Code reviews weren't
   getting done "on time". We were ending up with code that had passed QA,
   but wasn't reviewed by another engineer.

   We had been accustomed to merging code upstream as soon as something
   passed QA, and we were feeling pain now. The workflow wasn't working.

   Experiment #4 - Continuous code review

   After all of our experiments so far, we finally realized that code
   review shouldn't be a formal part of the process. Instead, we should
   train ourselves to do it all the time. We call this continuous code
   review.

   We review code earlier in the process. Sometimes, we'll write some
   code, open the pull request, and pair up with another engineer to
   review. If code is in the QA stage before the first code review, we've
   failed.

   If I had to come up with a rule, I'd say you should do your first code
   review halfway through implementation.  We don't really like rules
   though. Smart engineers can use their own discretion and figure out
   when a review would help them out. This has helped as immensely so far,
   but it's still too early to tell if this is the experiment we'll call a
   success.

   Our goal is to ingrain code review in our culture. We know it improves
   quality. We know it makes us smarter. We know we want to do it. So do
   it.

[42]Judge receiving kickbacks for imprisoning children gets 28 years

   [43]August 6, 2013 [44]Andrew Wicklander

     Judge Mark A. Ciavarella, 63, serves as an example of why the
     private prison industry can do more harm than good. Ciavarella
     worked alongside owners of private juvenile facilities to ensure
     that the prison remained occupied. The more prisoners equated to
     more profits for the owners of the prison.

     As a result, Ciavarella would sentence offenders with small offenses
     to months and, at times, years behind bars. He once sentenced a teen
     to three months in jail for creating a MySpace page that mocked her
     school’s assistant principal. Ciavarella also sentenced another teen
     to 90 days in jail after a simple schoolyard fight.

   Disgusting.

[47]U.S. directs agents to cover up program used to investigate Americans

   [48]August 5, 2013 [49]Andrew Wicklander

   [50]Via Reuters:

     A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is funneling
     information from intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, informants and a
     massive database of telephone records to authorities across the
     nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans.

     Although these cases rarely involve national security issues,
     documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have
     been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin - not
     only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and
     judges.

     The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to
     "recreate" the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the
     information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a
     defendant's Constitutional right to a fair trial. If defendants
     don't know how an investigation began, they cannot know to ask to
     review potential sources of exculpatory evidence - information that
     could reveal entrapment, mistakes or biased witnesses.

[53]NSA program collects 'nearly everything a user does on the internet'

   [54]July 31, 2013 [55]Andrew Wicklander

   The [56]latest revelations by the Guardian about the NSA spying program

     US officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the
     Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of
     Snowden's assertion: "He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what
     he was saying he could do."

     But training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it
     and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a
     simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the
     search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel
     before it is processed.

   I'm shocked (shocked!) that the government was lying and not Snowden.

[59]Not all that technology replaces is obsolete

   [60]July 29, 2013 [61]Andrew Wicklander

   Beautiful video on the [62]about page of Kathy Sierra's new blog:

     100 years after horses were declared "obsolete", the recreational
     horse industry in the United States alone is $40billion. Yes, that's
     with a "b". Sometimes a technological replacement reveals a deeper
     underlying value. From printed books to vinyl records,
     not everything rendered obsolete vanishes.
