   Duvet is a GUI tool for visualizing code coverage results produced by
   [7]coverage.py.

   Why the name Duvet? Because a duvet doesn't just provide coverage - it
   keeps you warm and cozy.

Quickstart

   In your virtualenv, install Duvet, generate some coverage data, and
   then run duvet:
$ pip install duvet
$ coverage run myscript.py arg1 arg2
$ duvet

   This will pop up a GUI window: [8]Screenshot of Duvet GUI after running
   a test suite. This window displays all source code in your current
   working directory. Any source file mentioned in the coverage data will
   be highlighted in the source file tree, with a color indicating how
   good the coverage is (red for bad coverage, green for perfect
   coverage). If you select a filename in the tree, the contents of that
   file will be displayed, with the missed lines highlighted.

Problems under Ubuntu

   Ubuntu's packaging of Python omits the idlelib library from it's base
   packge. If you're using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu 13.04, you can install
   idlelib by running:

$ sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7

   For other versions of Python and Ubuntu, you'll need to adjust this as
   appropriate.

Problems under Windows

   If you're running Duvet in a virtualenv under Windows, you'll need to
   set an environment variable so that Duvet can find the TCL graphics
   library:
$ set TCL_LIBRARY=c:\Python27\tcl\tcl8.5

   You'll need to adjust the exact path to reflect your local Python
   install. You may find it helpful to put this line in the
   ``activate.bat`` script for your virtual environment so that it is
   automatically set whenever the virtualenv is activated.

   Documentation for Duvet can be found on [9]Read The Docs.
