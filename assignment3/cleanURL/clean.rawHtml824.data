Wisconsin College Road Trip: Marquette University

Learn what it’s like to attend college in Milwaukee.

   By [49]Kelsey Sheehy
   September 25, 2013 [50]RSS Feed [51]Print
   Active learning – through internships, volunteering and study abroad –
   is part of Marquette’s mission.

   Active learning – through internships, volunteering and study abroad –
   is part of Marquette’s mission.

   If Goldilocks were looking for a college, [52]Marquette University
   might be just right. The not-too-big, not-too-small school in midsize
   Milwaukee is home to roughly 8,000 undergraduate students and inhabits
   several blocks in the heart of this city of nearly 600,000.

   "We really provide a balance," says Andy Schneider, assistant dean of
   undergraduate admissions. "You get the opportunities and the access to
   things academically and extracurricularly that you'd find at much
   larger schools," he notes, and "the attention that you'd find at much
   smaller schools."

   Students are surrounded by sophisticated research facilities like the
   Integrative Neuroscience Research Center, for example, and are able to
   enjoy big-ticket athletics – the men's Golden Eagles basketball team
   attracts a rabid fan base – but they don't have to deal with feeling
   lost in large anonymous classes or on a sprawling campus.

   The university is split across the center by Wisconsin Avenue; north of
   the divide sits the social and residential side of campus, home to
   residence halls and campus apartments and fraternity and sorority
   houses. Academics are contained on the south side.

   [Consider the [53]pros and cons of participating in Greek life.]

   Cutting-edge nursing facilities and a $50 million state-of-the-art
   engineering hall stand alongside centuries-old St. Joan of Arc Chapel,
   which was transported brick-by-brick from France and eventually given
   to the Jesuit school as a gift and rebuilt on the school's quad.

   The chapel still holds daily Mass – the most popular one being on
   Tuesday evenings, when close to 200 students pack into the tiny
   sanctuary. "It's definitely on everyone's bucket list to do before
   graduation," says recent graduate Elizabeth Johnson.

   Also on the bucket list, according to students and alumni: Attend a
   basketball game, get pelted in the annual snowball fight and polish off
   a Double Sobelman with jalapenos from the neighborhood burger joint.

   Active learning – through [54]internships, volunteering and study
   abroad – is a Marquette staple, and part of the school's mission as a
   Jesuit institution.

   Roughly 95 percent of undergraduates participate in service projects
   such as tutoring or mentoring local students; some professors integrate
   community service into their course requirements.

   [See how [55]community service can pay off with scholarships.]

   Students are encouraged to complete at least one internship before
   graduating, and some go well beyond that mark. "I'm on my 11th
   internship," says Johnson, who managed to find work every semester and
   summer of her college career.

   Practical experience happens inside the classroom, too. Engineering
   students had a hand in designing both the former and the new
   engineering halls.

   The school is not inexpensive, but roughly 55 percent of Marquette
   undergraduates receive need-based scholarships or grants. The average
   award totals just over $12,000.

   The university has an active social media presence, which parents and
   alumni have embraced as well as students. Marquette families use the
   school's social media channels to get help on issues large and small,
   says Andy Brodzeller, a Marquette alum and associate director of
   university communication.

   He recalls a time when a mother posted that her daughter's car had
   broken down just when she needed it to get to a dentist appointment. A
   local mom offered her daughter's help, and when it turned out she was
   unavailable because of class, drove in and acted as chauffeur herself.

   Looked at one way, that might count as overinvolved parenting. But
   those who live here see it as a sign of the Marquette difference.
