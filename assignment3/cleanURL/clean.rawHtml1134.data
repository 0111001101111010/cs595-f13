   From: Scott Voelker
   Dear Friend,
   If you're FRUSTRATED trying to figure out how to get good lighting and
   create professional portraits...don't worry, because you're not ALONE!
   I was there myself around 12 years ago, who had no idea how to take
   good pictures. But…my wife and I, who is also a photographer…had a
   passion and a desire to learn.

   That's me and my wife Lisa
   5

   Lisa put me in charge of figuring out all the technical stuff and
   basically said...let me know when it's ready :-)
   Here's a list of what I had to figure out...
   small_arrow 1.What lights and equipment do we need and what to Buy?
   small_arrow 2.What's better...Umbrellas or Softboxes? (or what the heck
   are they?)
   small_arrow 3.What is better Continuous Lighting or Strobes?
   small_arrow 4.How to use my flash on the camera to eliminate shadows
   and get professional shots?
   small_arrow 5.How to get professional results using a (1) light set up?
   small_arrow 6.How to use a Hairlight and should I?
   small_arrow 7.How to add more than 1 light?
   small_arrow 8.How to Use Gels?
   small_arrow 9.How to create low key and hi-key shots?

   This List Goes On and On...

   But, you get the point :-)
   I was frustrated and confused and just kept buying stuff I didn’t need
   hoping it would be the magic bullet. I later found out, that I could
   have received Great results with Basic equipment, if I would of had a
   good teacher.
   I would go to my local camera store and ask questions and feel like
   they were annoyed. Then I would ask less questions and try to figure it
   out on my own...and get FRUSTRATED!
   Over the years I figured out the hard way how to get professional
   pictures and eventually we opened a full time portrait studio that
   supported my family. (I still remember the day I told my Boss...I
   Quit!)

   I Started Teaching Online Over 2 Years Ago

   Then I took what I learned on the business side and started teaching my
   business plan also known as our “NewPortraitBiz Photography Business
   Plan” .
   Now..I wasn't a lighting expert, but I got the job done and I built a
   business around it.
   After teaching my course online now for over 2 years, I hear what lots
   of people are struggling with every single day. That's why I
   said...You're Not Alone!
   Most people struggle with this element and that's why I decided to
   create this workshop.

   But...I Couldn't Do It Alone! 

   I discovered Joe Marshall a 30 year veteran who knows a 100 times more
   than me on flash and studio lighting from teaching my NewPortrtaitBiz
   course.

   joe
   AKA: The Professor

   We became very good friends and I felt he would be an AWESOME
   teacher...because he's already been teaching this stuff.
   Joe is a well know Photographer in the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida  area
   for teaching “lighting workshops” to local camera clubs and various
   other events.
   I always feel after I talk to Joe, I have a lot to learn still and I
   take every chance I get to pick his brain. I’m always wanting to learn
   more about getting better portraits and adding new techniques to my bag
   of tricks.
   So…I asked if he would join me in teaching an online workshop together
   and he agreed. I myself know how to get good lighting, but I wanted a
   professional who is passionate about lighting and makes things REAL
   easy to understand.

   as they say...The Rest Is History!

   After 6 months of us Skyping and creating many lessons and good
   content…The EzFlashPhotography Online Workshop was born and now people
   just like you and me can go through a full class in your pajamas…if
   you’d like :-)

   workshop1

   Seriously…we created this class to be spread out over a 3 week period
   with various lessons and homework to make sure you get results…Fast!
   This isn’t going to be a workshop with a bunch of theory that’s boring.
   The lessons are in small bite size pieces and straight to the point…so
   you to get results. Plus…you get assignments to practice what you’ve
   learned.
   If you’re like me…I learn best by doing it. That’s what a workshop
   does. Joe creates simple lighting recipes and has you use them to
   create your own portraits.
   It’s pretty Brilliant and this format has been proven to help people
   learn better.

   so...What's In The Class?

   Once you sign up for the class, you will be sent to “The Classroom”
   where you will have access to Week #1′s lessons. You can take your time
   and go though these at your own pace.

   week1
   1a

   After 7 days, you will see Week #2 available in your members area and
   you can  start watching and practicing from each one. There’s between 5
   – 7 lessons per week, so you can watch one per day if that’s all the
   time you have.

   week2
   2a

   Then after another 7 days goes by , Week #3′s lessons will be available
   for you in your member’s area. This was designed so you don’t get
   overwhelmed and actually do the assignments.

   week3
   3c

   After you complete all 3 weeks worth of lessons, you will always have
   access to these to go back, review and keep practicing. This is
   something you don’t get if you attend a college course or other
   educational workshops. The lessons will be there for you and so will
   the support!

   ==============================================================
   Bonus #1
   Our Unique Support Chain (Life Line)

   When we created this class, we wanted it to be easy for every student
   to get the support they needed. So we created what we now call a
   “Support Chain” under each video lesson.

   How Does It Work?

   You will find a comments box under each lesson, where you can ask a
   question for Joe or I to answer. Plus, you get to read past Questions
   and Answers others had and learn from them as well.

   support_chain  

   This is a very powerful element to this class and it makes it “SUPER”
   easy to get answers…Fast!

   Bonus #2

   Plus...you get to Download all the slides from each lesson (There's
   over 200 slides in this class)

   We will posting all coaching calls we create for this
   EzFlashPhotography class in the BONUS section to listen and download.
   We will record them, so everyone can benefit from listening to Joe and
   I  answering some common questions. You may have the same question and
   now you’ll get the answer.

   ==============================================================
    Bonus #4
   Special BONUS Section
   bonus2  

   We will be adding extra content in this section that we feel will help
   you even further. It could be a lesson we created because people were
   struggling with a certain technique or  maybe a student wants us to do
   a “Hot Seat” helping them with their set up.
   We will then record the call or video and add it the the Special Bonus
   Section!
   Joe recorded a workshop in Ft. Lauderdale about 6 months ago and had it
   recorded, so you can watch the actual footage from the event in this
   BONUS section.

   What's This Workshop Worth?

   Well...if Joe was to teach private photography lessons, (Which he
   currently doesn't) he would charge a minimum of $100 per hour. That's
   if he had the time and it would be well worth the small investment that
   you could benefit and use FOREVER!

   In this EzFlashPhotography Workshop Joe teaches you over 4 hours of
   lessons...over the course of 3 weeks.

   What's The Cost To Join?

   We wanted to make this affordable by offering this as an online class
   and spread the cost over multiple students. By doing this we decided to
   charge less than 2 hours of Joe's hourly rate.
