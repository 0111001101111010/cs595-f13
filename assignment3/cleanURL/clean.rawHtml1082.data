Engineers Build Computer Using Carbon Nanotube Technology

   Sep. 25, 2013  A team of Stanford engineers has built a basic computer
   using carbon nanotubes, a semiconductor material that has the potential
   to launch a new generation of electronic devices that run faster, while
   using less energy, than those made from silicon chips

   This unprecedented feat culminates years of efforts by scientists
   around the world to harness this promising material.

   The achievement is reported today in an article on the cover of Nature
   Magazine written by Max Shulaker and other doctoral students in
   electrical engineering. The research was led by Stanford professors
   Subhasish Mitra and H.S. Philip Wong.

   "People have been talking about a new era of carbon nanotube
   electronics moving beyond silicon," said Mitra, an electrical engineer
   and computer scientist and Chambers Faculty Scholar of Engineering.
   "But there have been few demonstrations of complete digital systems
   using this exciting technology. Here is the proof."

   Experts say the Stanford achievement will galvanize efforts to find
   successors to silicon chips, which could soon encounter physical limits
   that might prevent them from delivering smaller, faster, cheaper
   electronic devices.

   "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have long been considered as a potential
   successor to the silicon transistor," said Professor Jan Rabaey, a
   world expert on electronic circuits and systems at UC Berkeley.

   But until now it hasn't been clear that CNTs could fulfill those
   expectations.

   "There is no question that this will get the attention of researchers
   in the semiconductor community and entice them to explore how this
   technology can lead to smaller, more energy-efficient processors in the
   next decade," Rabaey said.

   Mihail Roco, senior advisor for Nanotechnology at the National Science
   Foundation, called the Stanford work "an important, scientific
   breakthrough."

   It was roughly 15 years ago that carbon nanotubes were first fashioned
   into transistors, the on-off switches at the heart of digital
   electronic systems.

   But a bedeviling array of imperfections in these carbon nanotubes has
   long frustrated efforts to build complex circuits using CNTs.

   Professor Giovanni De Micheli, director of the Institute of Electrical
   Engineering at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland,
   highlighted two key contributions the Stanford team has made to this
   worldwide effort.

   "First, they put in place a process for fabricating CNT-based
   circuits," De Micheli said. "Second, they built a simple but effective
   circuit that shows that computation is doable using CNTs."

   As Mitra said: "It's not just about the CNT computer. It's about a
   change in directions that shows you can build something real using
   nanotechnologies that move beyond silicon and its cousins."

   Why worry about a successor to silicon?

   Such concerns arise from the demands that designers place upon
   semiconductors and their fundamental workhorse unit, those on-off
   switches known as transistors.

   For decades, progress in electronics has meant shrinking the size of
   each transistor to pack more transistors on a chip. But as transistors
   become tinier they waste more power and generate more heat -- all in a
   smaller and smaller space, as evidenced by the warmth emanating from
   the bottom of a laptop.

   Many researchers believe that this power-wasting phenomenon could spell
   the end of Moore's Law, named for Intel Corp. co-founder Gordon Moore,
   who predicted in 1965 that the density of transistors would double
   roughly every two years, leading to smaller, faster and, as it turned
   out, cheaper electronics.

   But smaller, faster and cheaper has also meant smaller, faster and
   hotter.

   "Energy dissipation of silicon-based systems has been a major concern,"
   said Anantha Chandrakasan, head of electrical engineering and computer
   science at MIT and a world leader in chip research. He called the
   Stanford work "a major benchmark" in moving CNTs toward practical use.

   CNTs are long chains of carbon atoms that are extremely efficient at
   conducting and controlling electricity. They are so thin -- thousands
   of CNTs could fit side by side in a human hair -- that it takes very
   little energy to switch them off, according to Wong, co-author of the
   paper and the Williard R. and Inez Kerr Bell Professor at Stanford.

   "Think of it as stepping on a garden hose," Wong said. "The thinner the
   hose, the easier it is to shut off the flow."

   In theory, this combination of efficient conductivity and low-power
   switching make carbon nanotubes excellent candidates to serve as
   electronic transistors.

   "CNTs could take us at least an order of magnitude in performance
   beyond where you can project silicon could take us," Wong said.

   But inherent imperfections have stood in the way of putting this
   promising material to practical use.

   First, CNTs do not necessarily grow in neat parallel lines, as
   chipmakers would like.

   Over time, researchers have devised tricks to grow 99.5 percent of CNTs
   in straight lines. But with billions of nanotubes on a chip, even a
   tiny degree of misaligned tubes could cause errors, so that problem
   remained.

   A second type of imperfection has also stymied CNT technology.

   Depending on how the CNTs grow, a fraction of these carbon nanotubes
   can end up behaving like metallic wires that always conduct
   electricity, instead of acting like semiconductors that can be switched
   off.

   Since mass production is the eventual goal, researchers had to find
   ways to deal with misaligned and/or metallic CNTs without having to
   hunt for them like needles in a haystack.

   "We needed a way to design circuits without having to look for
   imperfections or even know where they were," Mitra said.

   The Stanford paper describes a two-pronged approach that the authors
   call an "imperfection-immune design."

   To eliminate the wire-like or metallic nanotubes, the Stanford team
   switched off all the good CNTs. Then they pumped the semiconductor
   circuit full of electricity. All of that electricity concentrated in
   the metallic nanotubes, which grew so hot that they burned up and
   literally vaporized into tiny puffs of carbon dioxide. This
   sophisticated technique was able to eliminate virtually all of the
   metallic CNTs in the circuit at once.

   Bypassing the misaligned nanotubes required even greater subtlety.

   So the Stanford researchers created a powerful algorithm that maps out
   a circuit layout that is guaranteed to work no matter whether or where
   CNTs might be askew.

   "This 'imperfections-immune design' (technique) makes this discovery
   truly exemplary," said Sankar Basu, a program director at the National
   Science Foundation.

   The Stanford team used this imperfection-immune design to assemble a
   basic computer with 178 transistors, a limit imposed by the fact that
   they used the university's chip-making facilities rather than an
   industrial fabrication process.

   Their CNT computer performed tasks such as counting and number sorting.
   It runs a basic operating system that allows it to swap between these
   processes. In a demonstration of its potential, the researchers also
   showed that the CNT computer could run MIPS, a commercial instruction
   set developed in the early 1980s by then Stanford engineering professor
   and now university President John Hennessy.

   Though it could take years to mature, the Stanford approach points
   toward the possibility of industrial-scale production of carbon
   nanotube semiconductors, according to Naresh Shanbhag, a professor at
   the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and director of SONIC, a
   consortium for next-generation chip design research.

   "The Wong/Mitra paper demonstrates the promise of CNTs in designing
   complex computing systems," Shanbhag said, adding that this "will
   motivate researchers elsewhere" toward greater efforts in chip design
   beyond silicon.

   "These are initial necessary steps in taking carbon nanotubes from the
   chemistry lab to a real environment," said Supratik Guha, director of
   physical sciences for IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center and a
   world leader in CNT research.

   Professor Georges Gielen, Vice Rector of Science, Engineering and
   Technology at the Katholieke Universiteit in Leuven, Belgium, said the
   next generation of electronics, including wireless sensor networks and
   other tiny devices envisioned as part of the "Internet of things,"
   require low-power, high performance chips.

   "A big challenge for the massive deployment of such systems is the
   powering: wire line supply is impossible, batteries often not practical
   or affordable," Gielen said, adding: "CNTs are an emerging technology
   that offer the potential to cut down significantly, by orders of
   magnitude, on the power consumption of electronics compared to today's
   state-of-the-art technologies. If this materializes, this will be a
   major breakthrough for all the mentioned and future applications."
