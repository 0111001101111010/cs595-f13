How To Create Flat Style Breadcrumb Links with CSS

   [11]Read the full post

   With all the progressions of CSS and CSS3 over recent years we’ve
   reached a point where many of the old coding techniques that involved
   background images can now be created entirely with CSS. In this
   tutorial we’ll look at creating a series of breadcrumb navigation links
   in a flat design style without the need for the previously popular
   “sliding doors background image” method.

   [12]CSS breadcrumb links

   The breadcrumb links we’ll be creating are styled with chevron shapes
   to support the idea of drilled down content. Previously a background
   PNG image would be used to create this chevron shape, but with the help
   of clever border techniques the same effect can be created purely with
   CSS.

   [13]View the CSS breadcrumb links demo
<div id="crumbs">
        <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Breadcrumb</a></li>
        </ul>
</div>

   We’ll begin by quickly fleshing out the breadcrumb navigation links as
   an unordered list. Each breadcrumb link will appear as an <li> with a
   nested anchor element.

#crumbs ul li a {
        display: block;
        float: left;
        height: 50px;
        background: #3498db;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 30px 40px 0 40px;
        position: relative;
        margin: 0 10px 0 0;

        font-size: 20px;
        text-decoration: none;
        color: #fff;
}

   The initial CSS code styles up each list item anchor as a neat blue
   rectangle. The text is positioned centrally within the space and equal
   padding is added to either side. In order to position elements
   absolutely later, position: relative; is added so those absolutely
   positioned objects will display relative to this parent element.

#crumbs ul li a:after {
        content: "";
        border-top: 40px solid red;
        border-bottom: 40px solid red;
        border-left: 40px solid blue;
        position: absolute; right: -40px; top: 0;
}

   We’ll now recreate the chevron effect in CSS that would previously only
   be achievable with a background image. Use the :after selector to
   create an extra element that can be styled up individually. The
   triangle shape is generated through the use of various CSS borders, so
   as you can see in the initial demo a single blue triangle can be
   created by applying top and bottom borders to intersect the overlap.
   These are currently coloured red for demonstration, but making these
   transparent will produce a single blue triangle. This border effect is
   then moved into place through absolute positioning.

border-top: 40px solid transparent;
border-bottom: 40px solid transparent;
border-left: 40px solid #3498db;

   The border effect with the correct colour values will produce the
   desired triangle which gives the breadcrumb link the popular chevron
   shape.

#crumbs ul li a:before {
        content: "";
        border-top: 40px solid transparent;
        border-bottom: 40px solid transparent;
        border-left: 40px solid #d4f2ff;
        position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;
}

   Using the same principle another triangle shape can be applied to the
   left of the breadcrumb link. This time the border colour is set the
   same as the page background to disguise parts of the blue link
   background colour.

padding: 30px 40px 0 80px;

   This additional triangle before the link affects the appearance of the
   text, but a simple padding adjustment will quickly rectify its
   appearance.

<div id="crumbs">
        <ul>
                <li><a href="#1">One</a></li>
                <li><a href="#2">Two</a></li>
                <li><a href="#3">Three</a></li>
                <li><a href="#4">Four</a></li>
                <li><a href="#5">Five</a></li>
        </ul>
</div>

   As more links are added to the HTML the series of breadcrumbs
   increases, each separated by the cool chevron shape thanks to the CSS
   border triangle effect and a touch of right margin.

#crumbs ul li:first-child a {
        border-top-left-radius: 10px; border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
}
#crumbs ul li:first-child a:before {
        display: none;
}

#crumbs ul li:last-child a {
        padding-right: 80px;
        border-top-right-radius: 10px; border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}
#crumbs ul li:last-child a:after {
        display: none;
}

   The full breadcrumb navigation list can be further styled by removing
   the triangle effect on the first and last items with the help of the
   :first-child and :last-child selectors, then given subtle rounded
   corners with border-radius.

   [14]CSS breadcrumb links
#crumbs ul li a:hover {
        background: #fa5ba5;
}
        #crumbs ul li a:hover:after {
                border-left-color: #fa5ba5;
        }

   All that’s left is to apply a hover effect to the links. Don’t forget
   to change the border-left-color on the hover state of the triangle
   effect so the whole breadcrumb link changes colour.

       I tried something similar to this once, but couldn’t figure out how
       to compensate for the offset difference in Firefox and Chrome.
       Your demo appears to have the same issue.
       When viewing the demo in firefox, the triangles are offset by 1
       pixel.

            How embarrassing, my browser wasn’t zoomed at 100% but was 1
            click off, that created the offset in firefox.
            Your demo appears to be working fine now.

       Looks great and your step-by-step instructions are excellent.
       In the past, coming from the old school, I’ve done menus like this,
       but with image maps. Haven’t attempted it lately and obviously if I
       do I’ll be returning to this tutorial to “borrow” your code ;-)

       the page and instead cascades down like a row of steps?

       I am having a problem where the :after element tips are hidden
       behind the :before elements. It is almost like the layering order
       needs to be reversed somehow.
       Can anyone help, it sounds like the same problem HenriD is having?

       To solve the missing point with the :after problem, add
       “z-index: 1;”
       at the end of
       #crumbs ul li a:after {
       …
       }

       Great tutorial! I have been using this technique for a while now,
       on several websites, so I created a kind of automated generator for
       it to make it raiser to change sizes and colors (on Codepen):

       i had my take on this concept:
       [83]http://codepen.io/stryju/pen/kHrAE
       differences:
       - transparent “border” between the blocks
       - inline-block blocks, not floating, so can be centered
       - animated transition
       let me know what you think.
