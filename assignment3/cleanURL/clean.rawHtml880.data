   The line-mode browser, launched in 1992, was the first readily
   accessible^1 browser for what we now know as the world wide web. It was
   not, however, the world’s first web browser. The very first web browser
   was called [6]WorldWideWeb^2 and was created by Tim Berners-Lee in
   1990.

   But WorldWideWeb only worked on the NeXT operating system. WorldWideWeb
   was a great piece of software, but it was important that the web should
   be accessible to many kinds of computers, not just NeXT machines.

   That’s where the line-mode browser came in. It was the first web
   browser with a cross-platform codebase so it could be installed on many
   different kinds of computers. It was a relatively simple piece of
   software with a very basic interface, but in the early days of the web,
   it was instrumental in demonstrating the power of this new medium.

You’ve come a long way, browser

   Web browsers today are quite powerful. They can run on all sorts of
   devices and display all kinds of content from plain text to images and
   video—you can even play games in modern web browsers.

   It wasn’t always this way. The line-mode browser could only display
   text. You couldn’t even use a mouse to click on links—you had to type
   in everything using a keyboard …even if you just wanted to follow a
   link!

   It sounds like a clunky experience (it was!) but wouldn’t you like to
   get a feeling of what it was like to browse the web back then? Well,
   thanks to the power of modern web browsers, you can.

   [8]Launch the line-mode browser simulator!

An unbroken line

   A good place to start your line-mode browsing is with [9]the first web
   page ever published. Using the line-mode browser simulator, you can see
   how this page would have looked over twenty years ago.

   What’s amazing is that the first web page still works in a modern
   browser. You’ll also find that many modern web pages will work in the
   line-mode browser. They won’t look the same, and you won’t see any
   images, but they’re still readable.

   That’s because HTML is backwards-compatible by design. The vocabulary
   has grown in scope since Tim Berners-Lee first introduced [10]just a
   handful of tags but new browsers still understand all the old tags, and
   the line-mode browser simply ignores any tags it doesn’t recognise.

Permission granted

   Thanks in part to the forgiving nature of HTML, the world wide web has
   become a huge success. The web has changed a lot in two decades but one
   fundamental principle has remained constant: you don’t need to ask
   anyone’s permission to publish a web page.

   Inspired by the culture of collaboration and sharing at CERN, [11]Tim
   Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau released their project into the public
   domain in 1993. That means nobody owns the world wide web. Or, to put
   in another way, the web belongs to all of us.

Footnotes

    1. Most computers were not very powerful in 1991, certainly not as
       powerful as the NeXT machine on which Tim Berners-Lee built the
       first browser. While that version was great for demos it wasn't
       great for spreading use. The line-mode browser changed that,
       allowing almost anyone with a terminal — no matter how dumb — to
       access and browse websites.
    2. Yep — the software really was called WorldWideWeb. The name was
       decided on a whim over lunch at CERN in the early summer in 1989.
       Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau had to submit a proposal for
       funding for their still unnamed project. Tim suggested, "Why don't
       we call it World Wide Web?" and Robert said, "Sure, why not." They
       both figured they could change it later if they needed to.
