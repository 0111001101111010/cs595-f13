Course Description

   This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming
   experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the
   role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help
   students, regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident of
   their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish
   useful goals. The class will use the Python™ programming language.

OCW Scholar Version

   OCW Scholar courses are designed for self-paced study with no
   registration required. They are substantially more complete than
   typical OCW courses, blending new online content with material used in
   MIT classes.
