China in space

How long a reach?

The International Astronautical Congress is meeting in Beijing. But what,
exactly, does China want from outer space?

   Sep 28th 2013 | Beijing |[92]From the print edition
     *
     * [93]Tweet

   THE Soviet Union in 1961. The United States in 1962. China in 2003. It
   took a long time for a taikonaut to join the list of cosmonauts and
   astronauts who have gone into orbit around Earth and (in a few cases)
   ventured beyond that, to the Moon. But China has now arrived as a space
   power, and one mark of this has been the International Astronautical
   Federation’s decision to hold its 64th congress in Beijing.

   The congress, which is attended by representatives of all the world’s
   space agencies, from America and Russia to Nigeria and Syria, is a
   place where eager boffins can discuss everything from the latest in
   rocket design and the effects of microgravity on the thyroid to how
   best an asteroid might be mined and how to weld metal for fuel tanks.

   All useful stuff, of course. But space travel has never been just about
   the science. It is also an arm of diplomacy, and so the congress serves
   too as a place where officials can exchange gossip and announce their
   plans.

   And that was just what Ma Xingrui, the head of the China National Space
   Administration (CNSA) and thus, in effect, the congress’s host, did. He
   confirmed that an unmanned lunar mission, Chang’e 3, will be launched
   in the first half of December. This means, if all goes well, that
   before the year is out a Chinese rover will roam the surface of the
   Moon. It will collect and analyse samples of lunar regolith (the
   crushed rock on the Moon’s surface that passes for soil there). It will
   make some ultraviolet observations of stars. And it will serve to
   remind the world that China intends—or at least says it intends—to send
   people to the Moon sometime soon as well.

   Mr Ma also confirmed that China plans to build a permanent space
   station by 2020. Such manned stations are expensive and scientifically
   useless, as the example of the largely American International Space
   Station (ISS), currently in orbit, eloquently demonstrates. But they do
   have diplomatic uses, and that was why Mr Ma reiterated in his speech
   that foreign guests will be welcome on board his station—in
   contradistinction to the ISS’s rather pointed ban on taikonauts—though
   any visitors will first have to learn Chinese. What he did not do,
   though, was comment on the aspect of China’s space programme that most
   concerns outsiders, namely exactly how militarised it is.

   One Chinese rover

   Most space programmes are military to some extent. Both America and the
   Soviet Union used modified missiles to launch their satellites and
   spacemen in the early days. And even in the days of the Space Shuttle,
   NASA was employing that device to put spy satellites into orbit, and
   recover them. For China’s space effort these still are the early days,
   so civilian and military applications remain intertwined.

   In July, for example, the CNSA launched a trio of satellites, allegedly
   as part of a project to clean up space near Earth by removing orbital
   debris. Such debris is indeed a problem, given the number of launches
   that have happened since the hoisting of Sputnik in 1957. Nor did China
   itself help when, during the testing of an anti-satellite weapon in
   2007, it blew one of its own redundant satellites into about 150,000
   pieces. So a charitable view might be that this mission was a piece of
   contrition. Cynics, however, suspect that what was actually launched
   was another type of antisatellite weapon—or, at most, a piece of
   dual-use technology which could act as a space-sweeper as well.

   One of the newly launched probes was indeed equipped with a robotic arm
   of the sort that might pick up space litter. The other two were, the
   story went, to stand in for bits of debris. But once initial tests were
   over, the satellite with the robotic arm made a number of unusual
   manoeuvres and approached not one of the devices it was launched with,
   but rather an ageing satellite in a different orbit—just the sort of
   behaviour that would be useful if you wanted to eliminate an
   observation or communication satellite belonging to another country.

   The Chinese are not the only ones working on space weaponry, of course.
   America is busy in the field, too. And that accounted for a slightly
   more desolate atmosphere at the meeting than is normal at astronautical
   congresses. American law prohibits NASA from collaborating with China,
   or even organising bilateral exchanges with it. That rather kiboshed
   the plethora of booths the agency would normally have brought to the
   party, particularly when it is celebrating the activities of a rover of
   its own—Curiosity, its fourth and largest roaming the surface of Mars.

   This did not stop NASA’s boss, Charles Bolden, addressing the
   conference, though. And more pertinently, Mr Bolden also had a note
   from Congress letting him off the legal leash so that, though he still
   could not talk with Mr Ma or his colleagues at the CNSA, he could at
   least meet members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to discuss
   matters of mutual interest. These matters included using satellites to
   study Earth itself—the most useful part of space science. But it would
   be surprising if the question of how to clean up space litter had not
   somehow come up too.
