BSA offers a unique College Prep Program so that our athletes who want to
play women’s collegiate soccer can learn about the recruitment and
scholarship process.

   [30]line-002

Program Overview

   Eligible Athletes: Girls who are or rising freshmen, sophomores and
   juniors
   Session Dates: This program is offered during sessions II, III, IV, and
   V.
   Cost: $250 (in addition to camp tuition)
   To Register: Select the College Prep Program on the online [31]Camper
   Application.

College Prep Athletes receive:

   An Individual Skill Assessment - Each player will participate in
   developing an assessment of her strengths, areas of improvement, and
   recommended collegiate level. The goal in this is assessment is not to
   terminally mark a player at a DI, DII, DIII or NAIA level, but rather
   to realistically calibrate future recruiting and training efforts.

   Fitness Assessment and Training - Athletes in this program will undergo
   college-level fitness assessments, compare their results to current
   college players, and become educated on how to train and play at the
   next level.

   An Education - College Prep Athletes will leave with a clear pathway to
   connect with the right college coaches. They will prepare mentally for
   the challenges of the college recruitment process, as well as the
   rigors of being a student-athlete.

Daily Schedule

   Each day, College Prep Athletes will experience:

   2 On-Field Sessions: Two training sessions each day, under the
   direction of College Prep coaches. The girls will train, be assessed,
   and receive individualized coaching with the rigor and intensity of
   college athletes.

   1 Classroom Session: One classroom session per day covers a range of
   topics including: NCAA rules and regulations; recruitment resources and
   samples; the differences between DI, DII, DIII, and NAIA; and how to
   pursue a college soccer scholarship. Athletes will complete a workbook
   that they can take home.

   1 Fitness Session: One session each day is dedicated to assessing and
   educating athletes on the proper techniques of and ways to improve
   vital fitness components, including: speed, agility, strength, power,
   flexibility, and balance.

   1 Elective Activity: College Prep Athletes will participate in one of
   the Academy’s daily [32]elective periods with the rest of our BSA
   athletes.

   1 Evening Activity: – College Prep Athletes participate in the
   Academy’s daily [33]evening activity programs with the rest of our BSA
   athletes.
