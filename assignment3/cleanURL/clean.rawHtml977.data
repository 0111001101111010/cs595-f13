Listening To Music Makes You Stupid

   POSSIBLE? LISTENING TO MUSIC MAKES YOU STUPID

   If you’re like most people, you think you can concentrate equally well
   on a given task while you’re listening to music… as when you are NOT
   listening to music. Plus, you likely also think that when you are
   multi-tasking, you are being MORE productive, not less.

   If the above describes you, you should continue reading. Assuming
   you’re interested in improving your performance on cognitive skills.

   According to the preliminary results of a new experiment conducted by
   This vs That, listening to music while attempting to find hidden words
   in a complicated word search puzzle will result in fewer found words,
   compared to that of a control group, who did not listen to music.

   In this case, the music we played was: Thunderstruck, by AC/DC.

   This vs That gathered 22 people in a hotel conference room. Each was
   seated in a chair and provided a pencil and the word search puzzle.
   Everyone was given 5 minutes to find the names of as many European
   countries in the word search puzzle as possible (see above). Once the
   experiment began, the proctor turned on his I-phone, connected to an
   external speaker and played Thunderstruck. Loud. Prior to the playing
   of the music, the participants had no idea music would be played.

   [16]Thunderstruck.006

   According to our analysis of the data thus far, people listening to
   Thunderstruck were able to find, on average, 6.68 words. The people who
   solved the puzzle without Thunderstruck blaring, were able to find 8.33
   words, on average.

   These results are in line with previous extensive
   [17]studies ([18]here, too) into cognitive performance while listening
   to music. Would the results be different if participants were listening
   to Disco? What about classical? What if they were hungry? Tired? Drunk?

   We’re going to find out… and get the results out ASAP.
