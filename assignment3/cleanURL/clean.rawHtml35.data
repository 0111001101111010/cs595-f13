Understanding Threads in Python

By : [9]Akshar Raaj

   We will see some examples of using threads in Python and how to avoid
   race conditions:

   You should run each example several times to notice that threads are
   unpredictable and that your results differ every time.

   Disclaimer: Forget anything you heard about GIL for now, because GIL is
   not going to mess up with scenarios I want to show.

Example 1:

   We want to fetch five different urls:

Single threaded way:

def get_responses():
    urls = ['http://www.google.com', 'http://www.amazon.com', 'http://www.ebay.c
om', 'http://www.alibaba.com', 'http://www.reddit.com']
    start = time.time()
    for url in urls:
        print url
        resp = urllib2.urlopen(url)
        print resp.getcode()
    print "Elapsed time: %s" % (time.time()-start)

get_response()

   Output is:
http://www.google.com 200
http://www.amazon.com 200
http://www.ebay.com 200
http://www.alibaba.com 200
http://www.reddit.com 200
Elapsed time: 3.0814409256

Explanation:

     * All the urls are fetched in sequence.
     * Unless the processor got response from a url, it didn't fetch the
       next url.
     * Network operations are time taking, so processor was idle during
       the time it was expecting the response from a url.

   Even in a single threaded program, there is one thread of execution.
   Let's call it main thread. So, last example had only one thread, i.e
   main thread.

Multi threaded way:

   You need to create a class which subclasses Thread:
from threading import Thread

class GetUrlThread(Thread):
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        super(GetUrlThread, self).__init__()

    def run(self):
        resp = urllib2.urlopen(self.url)
        print self.url, resp.getcode()

def get_responses():
    urls = ['http://www.google.com', 'http://www.amazon.com', 'http://www.ebay.c
om', 'http://www.alibaba.com', 'http://www.reddit.com']
    start = time.time()
    threads = []
    for url in urls:
        t = GetUrlThread(url)
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    print "Elapsed time: %s" % (time.time()-start)

get_responses()

   Output is:
http://www.reddit.com 200
http://www.google.com 200
http://www.amazon.com 200
http://www.alibaba.com 200
http://www.ebay.com 200
Elapsed time: 0.689890861511

Explanation:

     * Appreciate the improvement in running time of this program.
     * We wrote a multi threaded program to decrease processor's idle
       time. While waiting for response of a particular thread's url,
       processor can work on some other thread and fetch the other
       thread's url.
     * We wanted one thread to act on one url, so overridden the
       constructor of thread class to pass it a url.
     * Execution of a thread means execution of a thread's run().
     * So, whatever we want the thread to do must go in its run().
     * Created one thread for each url and called start() on it. This
       tells the processor that it can execute the particular thread i.e
       the run() of thread.
     * We don't want the elapsed time to be evaluated until all the
       threads have executed, join() comes in picture here.
     * Calling join() on a thread tells the main thread to wait for this
       particular thread to finish before the main thread can execute the
       next instruction.
     * We call join() on all the threads, so elapsed time will be printed
       only after all the threads have run.

Few things about threads

     * Processor might not execute run() of a thread immediately after
       start().
     * You can't say in which order run() of different threads will be
       called.
     * For a specific thread, it's guaranteed that the statements inside
       run() will be executed sequentially.
     * It means that first the the url associated with the thread will be
       fetched and only then the recieved response will be printed.

Example 2:

   We will demonstrate race condition with a program and then fix it:

   Read [10]wikipedia example to understand what race condition means.
#define a global variable
some_var = 0

class IncrementThread(Thread):
    def run(self):
        #we want to read a global variable
        #and then increment it
        global some_var
        read_value = some_var
        print "some_var in %s is %d" % (self.name, read_value)
        some_var = read_value + 1
        print "some_var in %s after increment is %d" % (self.name, some_var)

def use_increment_thread():
    threads = []
    for i in range(50):
        t = IncrementThread()
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
    print "After 50 modifications, some_var should have become 50"
    print "After 50 modifications, some_var is %d" % (some_var,)

use_increment_thread()

   Run this and you will find different result every time.

Explanation:

     * There is a global variable and all the threads will modify it.
     * All threads should add 1 to the existing value of the variable.
     * There are 50 threads, so at end the value of some_var should become
       50, but it doesn't.

Why some_var didn't reach 50?

     * At some point thread t1 read the value of some_var as 15 and then
       processor took the control from this thread and gave it to thread
       t2.
     * t2 also reads some_var as 15.
     * Both t1 and t2 reset the value of some_var to 15+1 i.e 16.
     * But when two threads act on some_var we expected it's value to be
       increased by 2.
     * So, we have a race condition here.
     * A similar race condition might have occurred few more times and so
       value of some_var at end remains something like 41 or 42 or
       anything less than 50.

Fix this race condition

   Change the run() of IncrementThread to:
from threading import Lock
lock = Lock()

class IncrementThread(Thread):
    def run(self):
        #we want to read a global variable
        #and then increment it
        global some_var
        lock.acquire()
        read_value = some_var
        print "some_var in %s is %d" % (self.name, read_value)
        some_var = read_value + 1
        print "some_var in %s after increment is %d" % (self.name, some_var)
        lock.release()

   You should run use_increment_thread again and the result will match
   your expectation.

Explanation:

     * Lock is used to guard against race condition.
     * If thread t1 has acquired the lock before performing a set of
       operations, no other thread can perform the same set of operation
       until t1 releases the lock.
     * We want to make sure that once t1 has read some_var, no other
       thread can read some_var until t1 is done with modifying the value
       of some_var.
     * So reading some_var and modifying it are logically related
       operations here.
     * And that is why we keep read and modify part of some_var guarded by
       a Lock instance.
     * Lock is a separate object and it will be acquired by the thread
       from whose context it is called.

Example 3

   In last example we saw how a global variable gets affected in
   multithreading. Let's see an example to verify that one thread cannot
   affect the instance variable of some other thread.

   Let's introduce time.sleep() in this example. It will make sure that a
   thread goes in suspended state and hence enforces thread switching to
   occur.
import time

class CreateListThread(Thread):
    def run(self):
        self.entries = []
        for i in range(10):
            time.sleep(1)
            self.entries.append(i)
        print self.entries

def use_create_list_thread():
    for i in range(3):
        t = CreateListThread()
        t.start()

use_create_list_thread()

   Run it few times and you will notice that the list do not get printed
   properly.

   Possibly the entries of one thread was getting printed and during this
   operation, processor switched to some other thread and started printing
   the entries for other thread. We want to ensure that entries get
   printed one after another for separate threads.

   Change run() of CreateListThread to use lock.
class CreateListThread(Thread):
    def run(self):
        self.entries = []
        for i in range(10):
            time.sleep(1)
            self.entries.append(i)
        lock.acquire()
        print self.entries
        lock.release()

   So, we put the print operation inside a lock. When one thread has
   acquired the lock and printing its entries, no other thread can print
   its entries. And so you will see entries of different threads printed
   on separate lines.

   This will show that all threads' entries, which is an instance
   variable, is a list with numbers from 0 to 9. So, thread switching
   doesn't affect the instance variable of a thread.

   I think you have a bug on your last example. This is what works for me
   synchronizing the threads:

   lock=Lock()
   class CreateListThread(Thread):
   def run(self):
   global lock
   self.entries = []
   for i in range(10):
   time.sleep(.01)
   self.entries.append(i)
   lock.acquire()
   print self.entries
   lock.release()

   @Ilias:
   Can you be more specific about the bug, the example works fine for me.

   berkay [23]29th Sept., 2013

   great examples, in second example if we add time.sleep(.01) after
   read_value = some_var it's better to see the some_var does not add to
   50 otherwise depending on processor's scheduler it's mostly 50.

   @Ilias the code is correct self.entries = [] is not a global variable.
   Only when started printing the entries of each thread, the others may
   print too, then it's not seen correctly printed out if lock is not
   used.
