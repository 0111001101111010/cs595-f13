   Jesus was the world's first tweeter because his sermons and messages
   were 'brief and full of meaning, a Vatican cardinal has claimed.

   Gianfranco Ravasi made the comments while addressing a group of
   newspaper editors at a conference in Italy.

   He said that Christ 'used tweets before everyone else, with elementary
   phrases made up of fewer than 45 characters such as 'Love one another'.

   He has his own Twitter account with around 56,000 followers.

   He was making reference to the fact that the idea of Twitter and
   spreading news and messages to large numbers of people is not a new
   phenomenon, and Jesus was a pioneer.

   He also linked Jesus to other modern-day technological development.

   'A bit like in television today, [Jesus] delivered a message through a
   story or a symbol.'

   Cardinal Ravasi also stated the church and clergymen should be doing
   all they can to take full advantage of the internet to get the message
   of God across to the masses.

   Cardinal Ravasi stated that the church should be doing all it can to
   take full advantage of the internet as a way of getting the message of
   God to the masses. Pope Benedict XVI was the first pontiff to join
   Twitter, and the current Pope Francis tweets in English to over three
   million followers, from the handle @pontifex, pictured

   'If a cleric, a pastor is not interested in communication, they are
   defying their duty.'

   Pope Benedict XVI was the first pontiff to join Twitter, and the
   current Pope Francis tweets in English to over three million followers,
   from the handle @pontifex.

   The first tweet, sent on 12 December 2012, said: 'Dear friends, I am
   pleased to get in touch with you through Twitter. Thank you for your
   generous response. I bless all of you from my heart.'

   Pope Benedict also asked followers to send him questions about faith
   using the #AskPontifex hashtag.

   Perhaps Jesus was the world’s first troll - if so, he was also the
   best. (Contrary to common conception, a troll is not a mere bully, but
   one who spreads false information or presents a massively stupid
   opinion to incite havoc.)

GADGET REVIEWS

   [242]Gadget review: Skullcandy Crusher Headphones
   [243]The Crusher does exactly what it says on the tin. Unleash an
   unrelenting torrent of deep bass through your eardrums. Be warned,
   these are not for the faint-hearted.

   [244]Gadget review: Klipsch Image X7i in-ear headphones with 3-button
   control
   [245]The Klipsch X7i headphones are nearly perfect. Nearly. The sound
   is excellent - and in headphones, that's 90 per cent of the battle won.
   Just some blips hold them back.

   [246]Gadget review: Samsung Galaxy S4 phone
   [247]At the end of July Samsung overtook Apple to become the world's
   most profitable mobile phone company. We look at the S4 to see why it's
   so popular.

   [248]Gadget of the week: Lepow Moonstone 6000 mobile power bank
   [249]Ever been out and about and your phone's run out of juice? Of
   course you have. The Lepow Moonstone 6000mAh portable powerbank could
   be a lifesaver.

   [250]Yurbuds Ironman Series headphones
   [251]The selling point of the Yurbuds are that they don't fall out.
   Which on the face of it, given that headphones are meant to stay in
   your ears, doesn't seem that big a deal.

   [252]Gadget of the week: Kansi 9twenty folding bike
   [253]Feast your eyes on the Kansi 9twenty - one of a range of four
   bikes on the market in the UK - highly functional and fab looking. Well
   worth the asking price.

   [254]Philips In Sight wireless home monitor
   [255]The Philips In Sight wireless home monitor is a brilliant way of
   keeping track of your home. Place it in any room and watch a live video
   feed from your smartphone.

   [256]Sennheiser Momentum over-ear headphones
   [257]Quality comes at a price, but not as much as youd think. The
   Momentums blend state-of-the-art design and materials with cutting-edge
   sound.

   [258]Philips ActionFit sports headband
   [259]I've always been skeptical about sports headphones that aren't
   in-ear. The pairs I have owned have either been uncomfortable or too
   loose.

   [260]WeSC Piston headphones
   [261]At £40, these WeSC Piston headphones seem somewhat of a bargain.
   Sadly, although their looks will win over fans, audio sounds muffled
   whatever the volume.

   [262]LifeProof iPhone case
   [263]Cracking your iPhone screen is one of the most annoying things you
   can do. Thankfully, the new LifeProof iPhone case will make this a
   thing of the past.
