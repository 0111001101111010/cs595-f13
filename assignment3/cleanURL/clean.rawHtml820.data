This Year's SAT Scores Are Out, and They're Grim

   Fewer than half of the 2013 graduating seniors who took the test got
   "college-ready" scores.

   Of the 1.66 million high school students in the class of 2013 who took
   the SAT, only 43 percent were academically prepared for college-level
   work, according to this year’s SAT Report on College & Career
   Readiness. For the fifth year in a row, fewer than half of SAT-takers
   received scores that qualified them as “college-ready.”

   The College Board considers a score of 1550 to be the “College and
   Career Readiness Benchmark.” Students who [125]meet the benchmark are
   more likely to enroll in a four-year college, more likely to earn a GPA
   of a B- or higher their freshman year, and more likely to complete
   their degree.

   “While some might see stagnant scores as no news, the College Board
   considers them a call to action. These scores can and must change — and
   the College Board feels a sense of responsibility to help make that
   happen,” the report said.

   The report also offered insights into why some students graduated high
   school prepared for college and others didn’t. Students in the class of
   2013 who met or exceeded the benchmark were more likely to have
   completed a core curriculum, to have taken honors or AP courses, and to
   have taken higher-level mathematics courses, like precalculus,
   calculus, and trigonometry.

   Although the SAT takers in the class of 2013 were the most diverse
   group of test takers ever, the report showed that minority students’
   scores have only slightly improved in the past year.

   While 14.8 percent of African-American SAT takers met or exceeded the
   SAT benchmark in 2012, 15.6 percent met or exceeded the mark in 2013.
   Similar gains were made among Hispanic SAT takers: 23.5 percent met the
   benchmark in 2013, up from 22.8 in 2012. This may be due to differing
   academic preparation between the groups: Only 66 percent of African
   American students and 70 percent of Hispanic students completed a Core
   Curriculum, in comparison to 80 percent of white students.
