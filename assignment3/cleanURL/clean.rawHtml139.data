   [59]Async / Await Feature in .NET 4.5 Task Parallel Library (TPL)
   Posted by editor. [60]Comment (0).

   [61]Async / Await feature in .NET 4.5 Task Parallel Library (TPL)
   Current trends in the software development require the application to
   demonstrate fast reaction in response to the user’s actions. A modern
   application cannot just ‘hang’ when performing any complex operation
   and forces the user to wait. Moreover, the question of rational use of
   computing resources is still important. Since modern PCs are
   multi-core, it is possible to speed up the complex calculation
   processes by running them on multiple cores simultaneously. As a
   result, it is difficult to imagine up-to-date software applications
   that doesn’t use async operations.

   Using async operations imposes some overhead on the programmer, as
   previously such operations were used only in the exceptional cases.

   The Task Parallel Library (TPL) for .NET 4.5 immensely simplifies the
   programming of async operations by using keywords async and await. Due
   to this the developer doesn’t need to worry about:
     * Creating a new thread
     * Thread synchronization
     * Calls to UI thread
     * The implementation of safe cross-thread calls
     * Catch insidious bugs related to multi-threaded operations

   TPL library effectively takes care of all those tasks.

   Also async / await increases the readability of the code, because the
   code looks as if all operations were performed synchronously, i.e.,
   easy to keep track of the sequence of operations.

   Here is an example of the async / await usage:

   // Three things to note in the signature: // – The method has an async
   modifier.

   // – The return type is Task or Task<T>. (See “Return Types” section.)

   // Here, it is Task<int> because the return statement returns an
   integer.

   // – The method name ends in “Async.”

   async Task<int> AccessTheWebAsync()

   {

   // You need to add a reference to System.Net.Http to declare client.

   HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

   // GetStringAsync returns a Task<string>. That means that when you
   await the

   // task you’ll get a string (urlContents).

   Task<string> getStringTask =
   client.GetStringAsync(“http://msdn.microsoft.com”);

   // You can do work here that doesn’t rely on the string from
   GetStringAsync.

   DoIndependentWork();

   // The await operator suspends AccessTheWebAsync.

   // – AccessTheWebAsync can’t continue until getStringTask is complete.

   // – Meanwhile, control returns to the caller of AccessTheWebAsync.

   // – Control resumes here when getStringTask is complete.

   // – The await operator then retrieves the string result from
   getStringTask.

   string urlContents = await getStringTask;

   // The return statement specifies an integer result.

   // Any methods that are awaiting AccessTheWebAsync retrieve the length
   value.

   return urlContents.Length;

   }

   About the Author
   Artem Groshevoi

   [64]Artem Groshevoi: “I was always interested in technical things. My
   first programming languages was Pascal, Delphi, and FoxPro. At the
   University I learned C# development and started to work as a
   freelancer. I always liked back-end programming tasks with high-load
   and complex requirements. Optimization of legacy applications is also
   one of my strong sides. Currently I’m working with C#, WPF,
   Silvelright, SQL, ASP.NET, WinRT, VB.NET.
   As a software engineer, I try to keep learning new things: languages
   (Ruby, JS), methodologies (TDD, BDD, Lean), and frameworks (Rails,
   SignalR). I’m a founder and contributor of several open-source
   projects. My hobby is learning computer algorithms on coursera.org,
   riding bicycle, and photography.”
