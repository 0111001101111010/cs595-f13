International Students: 8 Things To Know About Attending American Colleges

   American colleges and universities are extremely popular destinations
   for [23]international students. You can find out how many
   [24]international students are attending American schools by reading my
   last post:
   [25]International Students: Who is Attending American Universities
   If you want to study abroad in the United States some day, here are
   eight things that prospective [26]international students need to know:
   1. Not all international students, who attend American colleges and
   universities, are affluent, says Eric Staab, the admission dean at
   [27]Kalamazoo College in Michigan.
   "The wealthy tend to follow the Ivy League name brands or geographic
   location," says Staab. If a school is located in Boston or New York
   City, it has an easier time matriculating international students of
   varying academic abilities who need little support."
   2. Financial aid policies for [28]international students vary from
   school to school. While some universities are only interested in
   accepting students who can pay full-price for their college degree,
   many others provide financial aid and/or merit scholarships.
   3. To find out about financial aid and scholarships for international
   students at particular schools, look on a college's website for the
   admission counselor who handles foreign student applications.
   4. Prospective international student can also get a sense of the
   generosity of certain American colleges and universities by looking at
   a valuable list of colleges and universities that provide
   [29]international financial aid. This annual list, which is compiled by
   the [30]Overseas Association for College Admission Counseling, includes
   a breakdown of the number of international students who enrolled at
   individual schools, the number who received financial aid and the
   average international financial aid award.
   5. The United States government does not produce US News & World
   Report's [31]college rankings. Because "US" is in the magazine's title,
   many foreign students believe that the rankings are official and
   believable. These [32]college rankings are not official and the
   methodology is flawed.
   6. Ivy League schools are not the only American schools worth
   attending. One reason why international students hold Ivy League
   schools in such esteem is because of their lock at the top of US News'
   rankings.
   7. An overlooked source to attend colleges in the United States is the
   [33]liberal arts college. Some liberal arts colleges, are expanding
   their student bodies for economic reasons, Staab says, which is
   prompting more of them to look overseas for promising students.
   8. A great resource to learn about [34]liberal arts colleges is to read
   an extremely popular book entitled, [35]Colleges That Change Lives: 40
   Schools That Will Change the Way You Think About College by Loren Pope.
