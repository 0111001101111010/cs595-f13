The Second Coming of Java: A Relic Returns to Rule Web

Just in Time for Twitter

   On August 3, Twitter set a new record for tweets in a single second. As
   thousands of people in Japan jumped onto the service to discuss the
   television airing of the animated film [138]Castle in the Sky, it hit a
   one-second peak of 143,199 tweets. That’s a massive spike over the norm
   — about 5,700-tweets-per-second — and the site stayed up. “Our users
   didn’t experience a blip,” Krikorian recently [139]wrote.

   The moment was a far cry from the day Dmitry Medvedev visited Twitter
   HQ, and for Krikorian, it proves the worth of the company’s new
   architecture.

   Originally, Twitter was one, monolithic application built with Ruby on
   Rails. But now, it’s divided into about two hundred self-contained
   services that talk to each other. Each runs atop the JVM, with most
   written in Scala and some in Java and Clojure. One service handles the
   Twitter homepage. Another handles the Twitter mobile site. A third
   handles the application programming interfaces, or APIs, that feed
   other operations across the net. And so on.
   On August 3, Twitter hit a one-second peak of 143,199 tweets. That’s a
   massive spike over the norm — about 5,700-tweets-per-second — and the
   site stayed up

   The setup helps Twitter deal with traffic spikes. Because the JVM is so
   efficient, it can handle much larger amounts of traffic with fewer
   machines. But the new operation is also more nimble. All these services
   are designed to communicate with each other, but if one goes down, it
   doesn’t take the others down with it. The day we visited Krikorian at
   Twitter’s offices this month, the Twitter homepage went dark for many
   people across the globe, but other services, including the company’s
   mobile feed, kept on ticking.

   From LinkedIn to Tumblr, many other big web names have adopted a
   similar “services architecture,” and generally, they’re building these
   services with Java or related languages. Java programmers are easy to
   come by, and compared to C and C++, the languages that rival its
   popularity, Java is rather easy to use. “It’s the easiest of the fast
   languages,” says LinkedIn’s Kreps. But so much of this trend is driven
   by the JVM — and its ability to run more than just the Java language.

   The JVM provides what’s called “just-in-time compilation.” After
   writing software code, you have to compile it — convert it into the
   native language spoken by the machine that will run it. Traditionally,
   developers compile their code into machine language and then ship it
   off to the computer in question. But with just-in-time, or JIT,
   compilation, you can compile code as it is executing, gaining some
   extra speed by tailoring the compilation according to behavior of the
   application. Java still can’t match the speed of languages like C and
   C++, but according to Krikorian, it comes close enough.

   Plus, the JVM is specifically designed to run multiple tasks — or
   threads — at the same time, an essential part of running web services
   in the modern world. “Concurrency is more important than ever,” says
   Lee. “There is really no platform that compares to Java in that
   respect. It lets you write concurrent code — and extremely fast
   concurrent code.” The JVM does this for Java code, but it also does
   this for Scala, Clojure, and more.

   There was a time when many questioned the efficiency of the JVM. “I
   worked with Java a fair amount a long time ago,” says Tumblr software
   engineer Mike Hurwitz. “I was glad to leave it behind.” But nowadays,
   people like Hurwitz and Krikorian and Square’s Lee sing a very
   different tune. “The great thing about the JVM is that there’s a
   software library for everything,” says Hurwitz. “If you want to solve a
   problem — no matter how goofy — there is likely something you can load
   up and use.”

Ruby Derailed

   In 2006, when Twitter built its micro-blogging service with Ruby on
   Rails, it wasn’t alone. As the web experienced a rebirth in the
   mid-aughts, the programming tools of the moment were Ruby and PHP, two
   “dynamically typed” languages that let you build succinct code at an
   unusually fast clip. But time has shown that these languages just
   weren’t suited to running the world’s largest web services, and now
   they’ve taken a backseat to Java — at least on the big stage.

   “Ruby on Rails was great to get us to the point where we could make the
   decision to get off it,” says Krikorian. With Java, he explains,
   Twitter needs about ten times fewer machines to run its site than it
   would need with Ruby. And unlike the Rails programming framework, Java
   and Scala let Twitter readily share and modify its enormous codebase
   across a team of hundreds of developers.

   The Java language isn’t quite as easy to use as Ruby, but for Krikorian
   and his engineers, Scala is. “Scala seems like a more modern language,”
   he says. “It makes the transition from Ruby easier — and it’s just more
   fun.”

   The exception that proves the rule is Facebook. Facebook was originally
   built with PHP, and it still runs on PHP. But to solve the scale
   problem, the social networking site has taken a page from the Java
   book, moving its PHP code onto a custom-built [140]virtual machine that
   provides just-in-time compilation.
   ‘We just couldn’t get Ruby on Rails to scale to the size of Twitter.
   Ruby on Rails was great to get us to the point where we could make the
   decision to get off it’

                                                       — Raffi Krikorian

   Facebook enjoys this sort of in-house hack. But so many others have
   just moved away from their original languages. Much like Twitter,
   Square switched to Java from Ruby. Tumblr migrated to Scala after
   juggling several other tools. No less a name than Google has moved
   towards Java from C — though it still runs C in places.

   Meanwhile, outside the programming world, Java is still portrayed as
   security nightmare that no longer runs applications on PCs, laptops,
   and phones. And there’s some truth to this. Late last year, a spate of
   new security bugs shined a harsh light on Java as a way of running
   software on most personal machines.

   But thanks to a brand new virtual machine built specifically for mobile
   devices — Google’s [141]Dalvik virtual machine, the Java language has
   found new life on Android phones and tablets, where it’s the primary
   means of building applications. And on servers, it’s helping drive not
   only big name web services, but countless software applications used
   inside other businesses.

   Java has continued to evolve, even in the face of corporate dithering
   from the late Sun Microsystems. Sun, for all its faults, was clever
   enough to open source the JVM, and Oracle, which acquired Sun is 2010,
   has [142]proved to be a more active steward for the Java platform — to
   the surprise of many.

   As an open source project, the JVM is free for everyone to use, and
   anyone is free to build new software and even new programming languages
   that run atop it. In the wake of Scala, other developers are building a
   new language for the JVM called Ceylon, and if you like, you can even
   run Ruby atop the virtual machine, in the form of something called
   JRuby.

   Companies such as Twitter and LinkedIn and Square are constantly
   building new Java tools from scratch, and in many cases, they’re
   sharing this code with the rest of the world, much as Sun shared the
   JVM and other parts of Java. This open source code then spawns more
   open source code. And so on. “We all just pick and choose the things
   that meet our needs,” says Square’s Lee. “Companies like ours are
   building all sorts of custom infrastructure, but we also think it’s
   very important to open source.”

   The added benefit — for all these companies — is that, when the time
   comes, they can more easily move their services onto new types of
   hardware. They’re not writing code for specific servers or processors.
   They’re writing it for the JVM. So, when the world embraces a new type
   of server — [143]which is very much on the horizon — these Java houses
   needn’t rewrite everything. They can just move it to a new version of
   JVM.

   In other words, they’re ready for the next renaissance.
