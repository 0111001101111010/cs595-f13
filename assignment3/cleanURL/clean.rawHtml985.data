Late Cretaceous Period was likely ice-free

   September 25, 2013
   Study results could foreshadow Earth's future climate, MU researcher
   says
   COLUMBIA, Mo. - For years, scientists have thought that a continental
   ice sheet formed during the Late Cretaceous Period more than 90 million
   years ago when the climate was much warmer than it is today. Now, a
   University of Missouri researcher has found evidence suggesting that no
   ice sheet formed at this time. This finding could help
   environmentalists and scientists predict what the earth's climate will
   be as carbon dioxide levels continue to rise.
   "Currently, carbon dioxide levels are just above 400 parts per million
   (ppm), up approximately 120 ppm in the last 150 years and rising about
   2 ppm each year," said Ken MacLeod, a professor of geological sciences
   at MU. "In our study, we found that during the Late Cretaceous Period,
   when carbon dioxide levels were around 1,000 ppm, there were no
   continental ice sheets on earth. So, if carbon dioxide levels continue
   to rise, the earth will be ice-free once the climate comes into balance
   with the higher levels."
   In his study, MacLeod analyzed the fossilized shells of 90
   million-year-old planktic and benthic foraminifera, single-celled
   organisms about the size of a grain of salt. Measuring the ratios of
   different isotopes of oxygen and carbon in the fossils gives scientists
   information about past temperatures and other environmental conditions.
   The fossils, which were found in Tanzania, showed no evidence of
   cooling or changes in local water chemistry that would have been
   expected if a glacial event had occurred during that time period.
   "We know that the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are rising currently and
   are at the highest they have been in millions of years. We have records
   of how conditions have changed as CO2 levels have risen from 280 to 400
   ppm, but I believe it also is important to know what could happen when
   those levels reach 600 to 1000 ppm," MacLeod said. "At the rate that
   carbon dioxide levels are rising, we will reach 600 ppm around the end
   of this century. At that level of CO2, will ice sheets on Greenland and
   Antarctica be stable? If not, how will their melting affect the
   planet?"
   Previously, many scientists have thought that doubling CO2 levels would
   cause earth's temperature to increase as much as 3 degrees Celsius, or
   approximately 6 degrees Fahrenheit. However, the temperatures MacLeod
   believes existed in Tanzania 90 million years ago are more consistent
   with predictions that a doubling of CO2 levels would cause the earth's
   temperature could rise an average of 6 degrees Celsius, or
   approximately 11 degrees Fahrenheit.
   "While studying the past can help us predict the future, other
   challenges with modern warming still exist," MacLeod said. "The Late
   Cretaceous climate was very warm, but the earth adjusted as changes
   occurred over millions of years. We're seeing the same size changes,
   but they are happening over a couple of hundred years, maybe 10,000
   times faster. How that affects the equation is a big and difficult
   question."
   MacLeod's study was published in the October issue of the journal
   Geology.

   [31]Why Kids Breathe Easier in Summer
   A good night's sleep is important to our children's development. But
   with the first day of school just passed, many children are at
   increased risk for sleep breathing disorders that can impair their
   mental and physical development and hurt their academic performance.
   [32]CO2-hungry microbes might short-circuit the marine foodweb
   Do the smallest plankton organisms determine the future of the ocean? A
   five-week long field experiment of the European Project on Ocean
   Acidification (EPOCA) shows that pico- and nanophytoplankton benefit
   from higher carbon dioxide concentrations in the water, causing an
   imbalance in the food web.
   [33]Newly discovered ocean plume could be major source of iron
   Scientists have discovered a vast plume of iron and other
   micronutrients more than 1,000 km long billowing from hydrothermal
   vents in the South Atlantic Ocean.
   [34]Ozone-protection treaty had climate benefits, too, study says
   The global treaty that headed off destruction of earth's protective
   ozone layer has also prevented major disruption of global rainfall
   patterns, even though that was not a motivation for the treaty,
   according to a new study in the Journal of Climate.
   [35]Looking to the past to predict the future of climate change
   Climate changes how species interact with one another-and not just
   today. Scientists are studying trends from fossil records to understand
   how climate change impacted the world in the ancient past and to
   identify ways to predict how things may change in the future.
   [36]Ancient ice melt unearthed in Antarctic mud
   The East Antarctic Ice Sheet repeatedly melted back several hundred
   miles inland during several warming periods 3 million to 5 million
   years ago in the Pliocene Epoch, according to a new study in the
   journal Nature Geoscience.
   [37]Tropical ecosystems regulate variations in Earth's carbon dioxide
   levels
   The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy
   of Sciences, found that a temperature anomaly of just 1°C (in near
   surface air temperatures in the tropics) leads to a 3.5-Petagram
   (billion tonnes of carbon) anomaly in the annual CO2 growth rate, on
   average.
   [38]Ancient ice melt unearthed in Antarctic mud
   Global warming five million years ago may have caused parts of
   Antarctica's large ice sheets to melt and sea levels to rise by
   approximately 20 metres, scientists report today in the journal Nature
   Geoscience.
   [39]Changing Atmosphere Affects How Much Water Trees Need
   Spurred by increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, forests

   A study by scientists with the U.S. Forest Service, Harvard University

   by Timothy Mitchell (Author)

   Does oil wealth lead to political poverty? It often looks that way, but
   Carbon Democracy tells a more complex story. In this magisterial study,
   Timothy Mitchell rethinks the history of energy, bringing into his
   grasp as he does so environmental politics, the struggle for democracy,
   and the place of the Middle East in the modern world.
   With the rise of coal power, the producers who oversaw its production
   acquired the ability to shut down energy systems, a threat they used to
   build the first mass democracies. Oil offered the West an alternative,
   and with it came a new form of politics. Oil created a denatured
   political life whose central object – the economy – appeared capable of
   infinite growth. What followed was a Western democracy dependent on an
   undemocratic Middle East....
