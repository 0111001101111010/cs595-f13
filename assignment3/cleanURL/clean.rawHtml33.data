[14]How to access the first and the last elements in a dictionary python?

   up vote 1 down vote [15]favorite

   Before posting, I have already gone through [16]Python access to first
   element in dictionary, butI'm uncertain about this.

   I have a long dictionary and I've to get the values of its first and
   last keys. I can use dict[dict.keys()[0]] and dict[dict.keys()[-1]] to
   get the first and last elements, but since the key:value pairs are
   outputted in a random form(as in the positioning of the key:value pairs
   is random), will the solution provided in this link always work?

   Use an [24]OrderedDict, because a normal dictionary doesn't preserve
   the insertion order of its elements when traversing it. Here's how:
# import the right class
from collections import OrderedDict

# create and fill the dictionary
d = OrderedDict()
d['first']  = 1
d['second'] = 2
d['third']  = 3

# retrieve key/value pairs
els = list(d.items()) # explicitly convert to a list, in case it's Python 3.x

# get first inserted element
els[0]
=> ('first', 1)

# get last inserted element
els[-1]
=> ('third', 3)

   There is no such thing as "first" or "last" key in dictionary, which
   does not guarantee any particular ordering. So there is no possibility
   to get "first" or "last" element. You can only create your own wrapper
   around python dict, which will store the information about "first" and
   "last" object

   Something like
class MyDict:

  def __init__(self):
    self.first=None
    self.last=None
    self.dict={}

  def add( key, value ):
    if self.first==None: self.first=key
    self.last=key
    self.dict[key]=value

  def get( key ):
    return self.dict[key]

  def first():
    return self.dict[ self.first ]

  def last():
    return self.dict[ self.last ]

   Although as it was pointed out in the comment there is already a class
   OrderedDict:
   [29]http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Order
   edDict

     Ordered dictionaries are just like regular dictionaries but they
     remember the order that items were inserted. When iterating over an
     ordered dictionary, the items are returned in the order their keys
     were first added.

     Or use collections.OrderedDict, if its definition of "first" and "last"
     coincides with OP's. – [34]Bogdan Sep 26 at 13:55
     And how will I create a wrapper? Any demo? – [35]user1162512 Sep 26 at

   Python dictionaries are unordered, so "first" and "last" isn't defined.
   Instead, you can sort your keys, and then access the element associated
   with the first and last key in your sorted set.

   EDIT:

   The OP clarified that by "first" and "last" he meant the order in which
   keys were added to the dictionary. collections.OrderedDict should work
   for this case.

     Thats what I said. Is there any solution for this? – [40]user1162512
     Sep 26 at 13:54
     @user1162512 I've added a suggestion for sorting the keys, but that's
     the best you can do. – [41]Codie CodeMonkey Sep 26 at 13:56
     What if I store my dictionary as dict= {"xyz":294,"a":1,"rah":129}. On
     what basis would I sort the keys in order to get the access of xyz and
     rah. – [42]user1162512 Sep 26 at 13:57
     PS: I dont want to search using dict["xyz"] – [43]user1162512 Sep 26 at
     13:57

   1
     @user1162512: the second you write {"xyz":294,"a":1,"rah":129}, you've
     lost any information about the order, because that's a dictionary
     literal. As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, you can use
     collections.OrderedDict for an insertion-order variant. – [44]DSM Sep

     CPython implementation detail: Keys and values are listed in an
     arbitrary order which is non-random, varies across Python
     implementations, and depends on the dictionaryâs history of
     insertions and deletions. -- [46]dict documentation

   However I highly recommend to not rely on order of items in
   [47]associative array data structure (dict is one of them) since
   frequently there is no single obvious way to order keys. For example in
   python "21" < "3" while 21 > 3.
