   Today we’re excited to launch [24]BrowserSwarm – a new tool that helps
   web developers automate how they test their JavaScript projects across
   devices and browsers.

What is BrowserSwarm?

   BrowserSwarm is a partnership by Microsoft, [25]Sauce Labs and the open
   source team of [26]appendTo that helps developers automate how they
   test frameworks & libraries across browsers. It’s [27]powered through
   the cloud, allowing developers to save time setting-up multiple browser
   or device testing environments and precious server resources.

   [28]topframeworks

   [29]Web frameworks and libraries are the “building blocks” of the web
   found in every developer's toolbox. Hundreds of these new JavaScript
   projects are built by the open source community every year – sometimes
   in late-night hackathons and shared at places like JSConf or on GitHub
   – to simplify coding for common patterns like the web layout, user
   input, animations, game physics, even the process of detecting features
   in older versions of Internet Explorer. Few truly innovative
   experiences on the web is without some type of framework.

   Like testing websites across various devices and browsers, framework
   authors must also ensure their latest works well and performs reliably
   for developers to have full confidence in adopting it for their own
   sites. Most [30]top JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, dojo, prototype
   and Modernizr – used by over 50% of the top traffic websites worldwide
   – have enough resources to perform testing regularly. But what if
   you’re a startup building a new framework? Testing is probably the last
   (but necessary) thing you want to do. So – just like the free testing
   tools and resources on [31]modern.IE that help developers of
   public-facing sites or line-of-business web apps – we are partnering on
   [32]BrowserSwarm to help the developers that build stuff for developers
   – the framework authors. We want to help reduce the time spent testing
   frameworks (and the sites they service) so that developers have more
   time to innovate on the web.

How does BrowserSwarm Work?

   You set-up an account in minutes. [33]BrowserSwarm connects directly to
   your team’s code repository on GitHub. When you publish your latest
   project, BrowserSwarm automatically runs it against Unit Testing
   Frameworks like [34]QUnit in the cloud-powered browsing session using
   Sauce Labs’ automated testing platform. You get a “fix list” report
   across browsers, including modern and older versions of Internet
   Explorer.

How to add your Project to BrowserSwarm

   Begin by setting-up an account in minutes:

   1. Tell us who you are

   2. Add your GitHub repo

   3. BrowserSwarm completes the installation

   4. Publish your latest code

Less time testing, more time building ________.

   Partnerships like BrowserSwarm represent an [35]entirely new chapter in
   IE’s long history – [36]cutting edge IE11 performance, [37]free tools
   on modern.IE, [38]automatic updates, [39]modern web standards, and
   [40]advanced touch capabilities for example. Whether you’re a developer
   building the next framework or you design and build sites, share with
   us how we might continue to help you spend more time building what
   matters most to you and your users.
