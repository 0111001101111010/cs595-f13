[14]What is the need of JSF. When UI can be achieved from css html javascript
jQuery?

   I was reading about JSF that its a UI framework and provides some UI
   components. But how is it better or different from number of components
   that can are available from extjs or jQuery or combination of css and
   html and js. Why should someone learn JSF.

   JSF to plain JSP/Servlet/HTML/CSS/JS is like as jQuery to plain JS: do
   more with less code. To take [28]PrimeFaces as an example, browse
   through its [29]showcase to see complete code examples. [30]RichFaces
   has also a [31]showcase with complete code examples. If you study those
   examples closely, then you'll see that you basically need a simple
   Javabean class as model and a XHTML file as view.

   Note that you should not see JSF as replacement of alone HTML/CSS/JS,
   you should also take the server side part into account (specifically:
   JSP/Servlet). JSF removes the need of all the boilerplate of gathering
   HTTP request parameters, converting/validating them, updating the model
   values, executing the right Java method to do the business stuff and
   generating the HTML/CSS/JS boilerplate code. With JSF you basically end
   up with a XHTML page as view definition and a Javabean class as model
   definition. This greatly speeds up development.

   As with every component based web MVC framework, you have in JSF less
   fine-grained control over the rendered HTML/CSS/JS. Adding custom JS
   code isn't that easy as you have to take the JSF view state in the
   server side into account as well (e.g. enabling a disabled button in JS
   side won't enable the button in JSF side, which is in turn a huge
   security advantage). If that is however a major showstopper, then
   rather look for an action based web MVC framework like [32]Spring MVC.
   You'll only take into account that you have to write all that
   HTML/CSS/JS code yourself. Also if you fall back from Facelets to JSP,
   you'll miss advanced templating capabilities as well.

   On the other hand, if you have a big JSP/Servlet/HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery
   based website and you'd like to refactor the repeated
   JSP/Servlet/HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery boilerplate code into reusable
   components, then one of the solutions would be JSF. Custom templates,
   tagfiles and components can aid in this. In that perspective, JSF
   stands above JSP/Servlet/HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery (and that's also why it's
   pretty important to understand those basics before diving into JSF).

     Do more with less code? But with more xml... what a tradeoff...
     additionally, it robes you of flexibility – [41]Åukasz Lech Nov 25 '11

   JSF was created to make it so that java shops didn't have to learn
   stuff like jQuery and buil complex js but instead focus on a purely
   Java stack. In a world where time is money and lots of places already
   focusing on Java development, one less language/piece in the stack
   makes training and maintaining faster and thus cheaper.

   I'll add that JavaScript is easy to become a maintenance nightmare on
   large teams, especially if some of the developers on the project are
   not highly web savy.

     It all depends on the problem you are trying to solved and what team
     you are solving it with. – [47]Andrew White Dec 12 '10 at 15:15
     I agree on team, but i am interested in learning what different
     problems can JSF solve and js jQuery etc cannot. Just trying to buildup
     motivation to learn JSF. – [48]sushil bharwani Dec 12 '10 at 15:33

     None, it just provides a different way to solve the same problems.

     Even if you're really comfortable with JQuery, JSF is still really
     useful. It provides an easy way to connect server side code to client
     side representations. Some Facelets 'composite components' are only a
     rather thin wrapper around HTML and JS (including JQuery). They're a
     breeze to build and in general just make the whole client-server side
     connection way easier. – [50]Arjan Tijms Dec 13 '10 at 23:15

   With Javascript and frameworks such as jQuery you have full flexibility
   and full control . Wwith ext's etc you lose much control and must adapt
   to the framework. With JSF you totally lose control and must totally
   adapt to the framework. You're invoked in lifecycles etc. and finally
   you have no control when the call to the server can be made and where
   not. If you are to do something considered 'special', you're in very
   hard position. And in JSF world even such basic things as multicolumn
   table sort or fields where you can type only limited set of characters
   (such as number field) are considered 'special'.

   However, the more flexibility you have, the more errors or bad
   practices you can made. High flexibility works only with highly
   intelligent programmers, others will turn the project into unmanagable
   nightmare.

   But, with JSF and its limited flexibility, there's always only a few
   (or even only one) correct way to do something. You are very limited,
   you can't make shortcuts, you must write more XML etc. - but when
   adapting to standard, there's better control on the code the
   unexperienced or low-skilled programmers will produce. As a result, big
   corporations love JSF because it is 'safer' for them.

   When I moved from GWT to JSF, I was shocked, how many things, that was
   natural to me, was considered highly untypical and how much simple
   things were so hard to achieve. What's more, even making the smallest
   changes, such as adding ':' sign after label, which in GWT/jQuery
   powered app would be changing one function generating label, required
   changing dozens of files with localized properties, which wasn't even
   considered by anyone except me strange...

     PrimeFaces is based on jQuery so you have lots of flexibility on client
     side, also PrimeFaces components provide many hooks on client and
     server side as event callbacks for you to customize. Javascript APIs
     can be overriden and CSS as well for customized look. : label can be
     configured globally in web.xml for a more jQuery friendly character.

   I strongly disagree that jsf adds anything. It only adds overhead.
   Doing ui stuff on the server is the most ridiculous thing ive ever
   heard. And javascript on large teams works great - its called reusing
   code.

   Just wrap the jquery in some jsp tags, thats all you need and youre
   done, and dont endure the.shackles and scalability issues with.jsf and
   richfaces.

     JSF is geared towards form based applications. jQuery is nice (heck,
     lot of popular JSF component libraries like PrimeFaces, RichFaces and
     IceFaces even use it under the covers), but jQuery doesn't simplify
     processing form submits in the server side in any way. Using plain
     JSP/Servlet will only result in terrible boilerplate code. Again, JSF
     is not only HTML/CSS/JS, but also JSP/Servlet. – [58]BalusC Apr 30 '12

   The benefits of using JSF are not only in generating xhtml + css + js.
   Sometimes JSF imposes a restriction on the markup you can generate,
   like any component based framework. But JSF is not just for that, its
   lifecyle helps greately. After validating the input it can update the
   model and sync your server side beans without any effort. you just say
   "whatever the user types here, check if it's a number, if yes then
   store it in the property YY in object XX" and JSF will do all that.

   So yes, you can still use JQuery, JS, etc. But JSF provides many
   benefits when it comes to writing server side code and saves you from a
   lot of boiler plate.

   Having worked with JSF, Spring MVC, Struts, Grails, JQuery, and ExtJS
   my opinion is that Grails + ExtJS is one powerful combination.

   I would pick Grails over JSF any day. I like the completeness of ExtJS
   as the client side framework and library, but it comes with a steeper
   learning curve than JQuery.
