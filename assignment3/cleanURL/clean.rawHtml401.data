The opinionated FireShell framework. Built for the modern developer. For
teams and the individual, encouraging a better workflow. JavaScript task
running, build processes, autominification and file concatenation, wrapped
with an enhanced HTML5 boilerplated framework.

HTML5 Boilerplated

   A cutting edge take on the HTML5 boilerplate with some HTML5 semantics
   and WAI-ARIA roles for baseline semantic markup and web accessibility.

Sass OOCSS setup

   CSS structure for small projects and scaling big, a fantastic setup to
   get your Object-Orientated CSS scaling. Ships with fully adaptive
   folder hierarchies.

Grunt.js

   Compiling Sass/SCSS, concatenating JavaScript files, connecting to a
   localhost server and live file reloads and injection. Auto-minification
   for production.
