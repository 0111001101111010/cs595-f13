3 Unusual Computer Business Ideas

   3 Unusual Computer Business Ideas If you’re looking for computer
   business ideas, there’s plenty more you can do beyond fixing PCs and
   providing support. This article introduces three slightly more unusual
   [112]computer business ideas:

Asset Disposal

   All large businesses periodically replace their computer equipment.
   Even smaller firms often have a “PC graveyard” shoved in a corner.

   [113]Small businesses especially are often unsure of what to do with
   this equipment.

   Before computers can be recycled or sold, they must be cleansed of
   confidential data, resulting in a marketplace opportunity for companies
   who can [114]securely wipe data and sell the old equipment.

   Doing this requires good organizational skills, as well as considerable
   storage and workspace to process equipment for resale.

Eco-Friendly IT

   Providing a traditional [116]IT support and consultancy service with a
   green edge is perhaps the most rewarding of these unusual computer
   business ideas. Progressive businesses may welcome an IT partner that
   concentrates on [117]equipment with low power consumption, paperless
   practices, and environmental focus. Good research skills are necessary
   for this, in order to find the best equipment to suggest to your
   clients.

IT Auditing

   The typical knowledge gap between [118]small business owners and IT
   providers means that businesses often have inadequate knowledge of the
   quality of their IT provision. This creates an opportunity for expert
   consultants to go into companies to review their entire IT systems and
   report back to management on any shortcomings.

   Of the three unusual [119]computer business ideas, this one requires
   the most in-depth technical skills—expert knowledge and appropriate
   accreditation should be considered essential for reviewing the work of
   others.
