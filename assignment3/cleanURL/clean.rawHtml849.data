Slide 1 of 11 Arizona State University

   Applying to colleges can be a nerve-wracking process, especially if
   your SAT scores or GPA aren't very high. Take some of the stress out of
   the situation by applying to these colleges with high acceptance rates!

   Arizona State University is the largest college in the nation, as it
   enrolls just under 60,000 students. The Tempe, Arizona campus is
   massive, and there are a number of extracurricular activities
   available. Arizona State competes in the NCAA Pac-12 Conference and is
   home to many famous graduate programs. Students pay $9,724 in-state and
   $22,977 out-of-state for tuition, and mostly major in business or
   education.

   Acceptance Rate: 88.9%
