   Amateur hacker behind DDoS attack on China?
   Posted on 26 September 2013.
   [34]Bookmark and Share
   When, in late August, China's Domain Name Service was [35]targeted by a
   huge [36]DDoS attack which ultimately lead to many websites being
   completely inaccessible for a period of time, the questions everybody
   wanted answered were: who did it, and why?

                                 [ddos.jpg]

   According to the latest information made public by Wang Minghua, an
   operator with the National Computer Network Emergency Response
   Coordination Centre of China (CNCERT/CC), the attack seems to have been
   tied to by a single, amateur hacker from Qingdao in the Shandong
   province.
   The attack was not made on purpose, he says, as the hacker was looking
   to DDoS a game server and has attack government servers by mistake. The
   authorities managed to track him down because he mounted the attack
   from his own IP address.
   But, as South China Morning Post [37]notes, it's still possible that
   this suspect is not the actual attacker.
   In fact, not two weeks ago, an official statement from the authorities
   identified the attackers as a group of hackers with commercial
   interests who used a large botnet to mount the attack.
   Why the sudden change of stance? It's difficult to say. But a
   Shangai-based cybersecurity expert said he had his doubts about the
   "lone hacker" theory, saying that the attack was simply too expensive
   to launch for random, amateur hackers.
