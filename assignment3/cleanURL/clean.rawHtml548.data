   Talk description: "Sass 3.3 is coming soon and there are some amazing
   new features in it. In this talk, Sass & Compass creator and
   maintainer, Chris Eppstein, will show you how to use the new features
   in Sass 3.3 to create stylesheet authoring capabilities that you may
   have never thought possible. From integrated development in Chrome, to
   optimizing your mixin's output and new strategies for wrangling media
   queries. This talk is targeted at people familiar with the existing
   features in Sass. Prepare to have your mind blown."
