     "Burnham is a first-rate operation. I rely on them to coordinate
     many of the permit-related tasks that I am too busy to do myself. I
     draw on their knowledge on changing municipal requirements,
     proactive problem solving and would definitely recommend them to
     others."

   Rich Neubauer,
   McDonald's

     "I've had great success with Burnham for permit expediting, and
     recently learned they offer code consulting. They are great in
     meetings and provide excellent reports supported by detailed
     research and experience. I will use them whenever I have code issues
     on a project."

   Jeff Kennedy,
   Centaur Construction

     "I like Burnham because their response time is terrific. They're
     professional with a systematic approach and solid corporate
     infrastructure - and their web-based system shows me exactly what is
     happening with my permits at all times."

   Tom McCloskey,
   The Related Companies, L.P.

     "Working with Burnham makes the best use of my resources. It would
     be too costly for me to have staff who know as much as they do about
     the permit process."

   Mike Moravek,
   The John Buck Company

     "Burnham is always a vital part of our Project Team. Their level of
     service and professionalism far surpasses their competition. The
     first call I make when a new project comes in is to Burnham."

   Gregg Navins,
   OMARA Organization, Inc

     "We have tried other permit services in the past but only Burnham
     delivers the level of detail, follow through and accountability
     necessary to be successful in today's complex permit acquisition
     arena."

   Dave Morgan,
   The Body Shop

     "Speed and efficiency are paramount, we aren't looking for just
     another layer of project management. Burnham gets the process due to
     their strong knowledge of jurisdictional requirements, and excellent
     working relationships with municipal staffs."

   Glenn D. Middleton,
   Design Forum

     "We have come to rely heavily on Burnham's expertise... they have
     developed a professional consulting practice that we are proud to be
     associated with."

   Michael T Clune,
