Software as a Service

CS169.1x teaches the fundamentals for engineering long-lived software using
Agile techniques to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails.

ABOUT THIS COURSE

   CS169.1x teaches the fundamentals for engineering long-lasting software
   using highly-productive Agile techniques to develop Software as a
   Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails. Students will understand the new
   challenges and opportunities of SaaS versus shrink-wrapped software.
   They will understand and apply fundamental programming techniques to
   the design, development, testing, and public cloud deployment of a
   simple SaaS application. Students will use best-of-breed tools that
   support modern development techniques including behavior-driven design,
   user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair programming.
   Students will learn how modern programming language features like
   metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity and code
   maintainability. Students will work on weekly coding projects and
   quizzes. Those who successfully complete the assignments and earn a
   passing grade can get an honor code certificate or verified certificate
   from BerkeleyX. This run of the class includes all new videos, two new
   homeworks and all new exam questions.  The new class also includes
   embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and
   opportunities for remote pair programming with other students.  Group
   tutorial Q&A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through
   Google Hangouts and YouTube.

FAQs

How will this course be different from previous offerings?

   The presentation order and amount of time spent on some material is
   being changed in response to feedback from both on-campus and online
   students. This run of the class also includes all new videos, two new
   homeworks and all new exam questions. The new class also includes
   embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and
   opportunities for remote pair programming with other students. Group
   tutorial Q&A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through
   Google Hangouts and YouTube.

What is the format of the class?

   The class will consist of lecture videos, which are broken into small
   chunks, usually between eight and twelve minutes each. Some of these
   may contain integrated "check-yourself" questions. There will also be
   programming assignments and standalone exams/quizzes, which are not
   part of the video lectures.

How can I learn more about the course content?

   Please watch the video on this page that we recorded especially for
   this offering of the course.

Will the text of the lectures be available?

   Yes, transcripts of the course will be made available.

Do I need to watch the lectures live?

   No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure.

How much does it cost to take the course?

   Nothing: the course is free. The recommended textbook is not free
   (US$10 for Kindle ebook, US$30 hardcopy, US$33 for both starting
   October 10), but there are free online sources to follow if you do not
   wish to purchase textbooks.

What versions of Ruby and Rails will we use in the course?

   We will make available at least 2 weeks before class a virtual machine
   image with all required courseware. You can either download this image
   and run it using the free VirtualBox (virtualbox.org) software on any
   Intel x86-based computer, or you can deploy it on Amazon's Elastic
   Compute Cloud using instructions we will provide. In general, we'll be
   using Rails 3.2 and Ruby 1.9.3, but we will also be using many other
   tools, gems, and libraries that will be preinstalled.

Prerequisites:

   Programming proficiency in an object-oriented programming language such
   as Java, C#, C++, Python, or Ruby is required. We will teach the basics
   of Ruby at a very accelerated pace that assumes thorough familiarity
   with OOP inheritance, static/class vs. instance methods and attributes,
   recursion, hash tables/hash maps, list comprehensions, higher-order
   functions, lambda expressions. This course is NOT a good first course
   in programming. Basic Unix command-line skills are helpful; we will
   provide a cheat sheet.
