   Currently applied CSS: none
   <div id="target">

<h2>Where the Buggalo Roam</h2>

   <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship.
   Clamps, burn down the crew. No! Don't jump! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't
   make sense.</p>
   <div>

   <p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
   </div>

<h2>The Mutants Are Revolting</h2>

   <p>But, okay! I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.
   Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>

<h2>Space Pilot 3000</h2>

   <p>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.</p>
   </div>
