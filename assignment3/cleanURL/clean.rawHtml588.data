Jack Daniel's gets a kick out of new Frank Sinatra whiskey

   Frank Sinatra famously said, “Alcohol may be a man’s worst enemy but
   the Bible says love your enemy.”

   Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select is "smooth" and "bold" just like Ole Blue
   Eyes himself

   Jack Daniel's Sinatra Select is "smooth" and "bold" just like Ole Blue
   Eyes himself

   This month one of his favourite “enemies,” Jack Daniel’s, has honoured
   its most legendary fan with a special edition bottling.

   Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select is a “smooth but bold” whiskey made from a
   blend of selected “Sinatra barrels” and bottled at 45% ABV, said brand
   owner Bacardi Brown-Forman Brands.

   “The whiskey’s unique character is achieved by exposing the classic Old
   No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey to extra layers of toasted wood on the inner
   surface of the barrels,” explained master distiller Jeff Arnett.

   “This results in a smooth but bold whiskey, which embodies the smooth,
   bold character of Frank Sinatra and his impeccable taste,” he added.

   The company said the whiskey was a “must try” for any Jack Daniel’s
   enthusiasts and would be available in the UK in very limited quantities
   from 15 October.

   The bottle features Sinatra’s signature and “iconic” fedora, along with
   the Jack Daniel’s Country Club logo, designed by the man himself.

   Frank Sinatra Jnr said: “Dad would be very flattered by the
   association. This fine Tennessee Whiskey, or Old No. 7 as he referred
   to it, was a favourite part of my father’s life and he loved both
   sharing it with his friends and introducing it to new acquaintances.

   “I’m very pleased to continue to be a part of the Jack Daniel’s family
   and feel the introduction of Sinatra Select is an appropriate tribute
   as we near my father’s 100^th birthday in 2015”.
