Pakistan earthquake: Experts explain emergence of mud volcano

   island in sea
   [100]Map: Pakistan

   When a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Pakistan’s Baluchistan
   province on Tuesday, locals watched in amazement as a small island rose
   out of the sea 600 metres off the coast.

   Scientists have been studying data from the quake and fielding
   questions about what caused the island to appear.

   They have since said that the island is actually a mud volcano, caused
   by pressure in sediment below the seabed.

   The ABC contacted two experts to explain what exactly caused the mud
   volcano to form.

What is a mud volcano?

[101]Aftermath of the quake:

     * Death toll stands at 328 and is expected to rise
     * Some 373 people are reported injured
     * Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, Pangur, Chaghi and Khuzdar are the six
       districts affected
     * A state of emergency has been declared in Awaran\Around 90 per cent
       of housing in the area has been destroyed
     * Medical teams and the military have been deployed

   According to Professor Bill Collins, the director of the NSW Institute
   for Frontier Geoscience, the earthquake was the result of a collision
   between the Eurasian, Indian and Arabian plates.

   "It was a big earthquake by any standards," he said.

   "It was an oblique-strike-slip, which indicates both vertical and
   horizontal movement between plates."

   A mud volcano occurs when sediment is over-pressured by the shaking of
   an earthquake and eventually ruptures through its hard rock casing.

   "This particular area of ocean has a lot of sediment coming from the
   Himalayas, from the Indus River," Professor Collins said.

   It looked very, very strange to me and also a bit scary because
   suddenly a huge thing has emerged from the water.

   Gwadar resident Muhammad Rustam

   "Huge deposits of sand and mud are semi-consolidating into rock, but
   this has not completely happened.

   "Like when you stand on the beach and place your foot in the sand near
   the shore line - water comes up around it.

   "Liquefaction happens when the sand and mud compact during the shaking
   of an earthquake and the mud bursts out."

Not the first example of a mud volcano appearing

   GeoScience Australia duty seismologist Hugh Glanville says mud
   volcanoes are quite rare, although the area has experienced one before.

   "It does happen for example in Japan, and actually not so far from this
   event, off the coast of Pakistan in 1945," he said.

   "It might last a few months, like the previous island in the area did.

   "It depends on the mud pressure - some mud volcanoes have been known to
   stay for years."

   Professor Collins says mud volcanoes will remain for as long as the
   high pressure from the sediment exists.

   "It depends on how large and robust the particular mud volcano is," he
   said.

Dead fish, and the sound of hissing gas in eerie mudscape

   In a BBC report, local journalist Bahram Baloch described the scene on
   the island when he and friends decided to visit it on Wednesday
   morning.

   "It's an oval-shaped island which is about 250 feet to 300ft (76-91m)
   in length, and about 60 to 70ft above the water," he said.

   I stepped out, and was flabbergasted. I could see this grey,
   dome-shaped body in the distance, like a giant whale swimming near the
   surface. Hundreds of people had gathered to watch it in disbelief

   Local journalist Bahram Baloch

   Mr Baloch described the surface of the island as rough, covered mostly
   in mud, and made up of fine, coarse-grained sand.

   He and his friends landed on the one part of the island made up of
   solid rock.

   "There were dead fish on the surface. And on one side we could hear the
   hissing sound of the escaping gas," Mr Baloch said.

   The group put a match towards the fissures where the gas was leaking,
   and set it on fire.

   "We put the fire out in the end, but it was quite a hassle. Not even
   the water could kill it, unless one poured buckets over it."

Why is there gas coming out of the island?

   University of Melbourne earth scientist Professor Mike Sandiford said
   the mud volcano rose because of a combination of pressure caused by the
   earthquake and the pressure of gasses in the sediment.

   "When we deposit rocks at the surface they contain gases and organic
   matter," he said.

   "Fluid gets over-pressured and organic matter can turn into gas. The
   whole sediment begins to behave like liquid.

   "A mud volcano is an unstable pile of sediment and it might keep
   regenerating."

   Mr Glanville compared the event to shaking a bottle of soda.

   "When shaken, the liquid bursts out, he said.

   "An earthquake will shake and build the pressure of the gases until the
   mud rises from the sea floor to the surface.

   "It's a natural phenomena and not long term. It can change oxygen
   levels in the water because of the gases, particularly methane, which
   is flammable and toxic."
