   Hacker 'mercenaries' linked to Japan, South Korea spying: researchers

   Washington (Reuters) - A small, sophisticated international hacking
   group was responsible for a widely publicized 2011 spying attack on
   members of Japan's parliament as well as dozens of previously
   undisclosed breaches at government agencies and strategic companies in
   Japan and South Korea, security researchers said.

   Researchers at Kaspersky Lab believe they have found a squad of hackers
   for hire, who contract out to governments and possibly businesses, in
   contrast to recent reports on hacks said to be carried out by full-time
   government employees.

   "What we have here is the emergence of small groups of
   cyber-mercenaries available to perform targeted attacks," said
   Kaspersky's global research director, Costin Raiu, in an interview with
   Reuters.

   "We actually believe they have contracts, and they are interested in
   fulfilling whatever the contract requirements are," he said.

   The espionage against members of the Japanese Diet had been blamed by
   that country's officials on Chinese hackers, according to local media,
   but few details had been provided. Kaspersky attributed the attack to
   the new group. He was unable to say if the Chinese government was
   behind or contributed to the attack.

   Logs and other records show that the same group also took aim at some
   of the world's biggest shipbuilders, media companies and defense
   contractors including Selectron Industrial Co., although Kaspersky did
   not say which attacks had been successful.

   Selectron, which supplies U.S.-designed components to defense and
   industrial customers in Korea, Japan and elsewhere, had no immediate
   comment.

   Kaspersky said it was working with some of the companies and with law
   enforcement in multiple countries.

   In a report released on Wednesday, Kaspersky said researchers had won
   access to many of the command computers used in the campaigns and that
   logs and other material showed a long list of intended victims.

   They said that comments within the attack programs and the names of
   some internal files were in simplified Chinese, but that members of the
   group were also conversant in Japanese and Korean, suggesting a
   presence in all three countries.

   Servers were discovered in China, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and
   the United States.

   Hacking teams often suck up enormous amounts of data with little
   discrimination over long periods, aiming to filter through the trove
   afterwards, according to reports suspected state-sponsored electronic
   espionage.

   But this team acted with great precision, targeting specific documents
   or log-in credentials and then leaving the victimized network within
   weeks.

   The report by Moscow-based Kaspersky follows a September 17 research
   paper by SymantecCorp that blamed a separate, larger Chinese group for
   well-known attacks on Google Inc, EMC Corp's RSA division, and Adobe
   Systems Inc.

   Kaspersky dubbed the new campaign IceFog, after the name of one of the
   control servers, and said attacks typically began with emails tailored
   to a specific person at a victim company.

   Microsoft Word or other attachments, once opened, allowed direct access
   to the attackers, who then roamed the network looking for blueprints or
   other treasure. The multiple security holes that were used were
   previously known, but the systems had not been patched.

   There were a few dozen victims who used Windows, Raiu said. A Mac
   variant of the same malicious software was detected in thousands of
   infections, but was spread casually on a Chinese-language bulletin
   board, perhaps as a test. He said there was no evidence that any of the
   Mac victims had files copied and removed.

   The hackers have changed their attack software in the past two years,
   leaving fewer clues to what was done, Kaspersky said.

   The objectives of the customers appeared to vary. In one case, the
   detailed budget for a national army was sought, Kaspersky said,
   declining to name the army. In other cases, product blueprints were
   sought.

   Raiu saw no evidence of tampering or destruction, only the removal of
   sensitive information.
