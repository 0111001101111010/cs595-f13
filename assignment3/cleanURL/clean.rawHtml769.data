   The last post in this week's Kinect for Windows SDK v1.8 theme week is
   a document that everyone doing any Kinect development should (must?)
   read and understand...

   Developing Kinect application is very different than other kinds. It's
   not keyboard, mouse or touch. It's something different. Don't reinvent
   the wheel. Learn from the hard lessons of others. You don't have to
   start your design from scratch.

   This 142 page document will help you hit the ground running and avoid
   costly mistakes...

[49]Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)

     Introduction
     Welcome to the world of Microsoft Kinect for Windows–enabled
     applications. This document is your roadmap to building exciting
     human-computer interaction solutions you once thought were
     impossible.

     We want to help make your experience with Microsoft Kinect for
     Windows, and your users’ experiences, the best. So, we’re going to
     set you off on a path toward success by sharing our most effective
     design tips, based on our long-term design, development, and
     usability work. You’ll be able to focus on all those unique
     challenges you want to tackle.

     Keep this guide at hand – because, as we regularly update it to
     reflect both our ongoing findings and the evolving capabilities of
     Kinect for Windows, you’ll stay on the cutting edge.

     Before we get into design tips, it will help to start with a couple
     of basics: a quick introduction to the Kinect for Windows sensor,
     software development kit (SDK), and Developer Toolkit, and some
     environment and sensor setup considerations.

     Conclusion
     Kinect for Windows is at the forefront of the revolution known as
     NUI—Natural User Interface. The next generation of human-computer
     interaction, NUI lets people interact with any device, anywhere,
     using the movements and language they use every day in their lives.
     Microsoft Kinect for Windows–enabled applications open a broad range
     of new possibilities for people to interact with computers in ways
     that feel natural. From business to the arts, from education to
     gaming, and beyond, NUI expands the horizons of application
     development.

     In this document we’ve provided you with the tenets and best
     practices for creating
     NUI applications, and guidance on both the basic and more advanced
     Kinect for Windows interactions for gesture and voice. We hope our
     suggestions help you create “magical” experiences for your users.
     Your development of touch-free, natural UI will shape the way people
     experience and interact with software applications for years to
     come.
