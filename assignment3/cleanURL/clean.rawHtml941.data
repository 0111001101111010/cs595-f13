   Kids everywhere grumble about homework. But their complaints will hold
   no water with a group of theoretical physicists who’ve spent almost 50
   years solving one homework problem—a calculation of one type of
   subatomic particle decay aimed at helping to answer the question of why
   the early universe ended up with an excess of matter.

   Without that excess, the matter and antimatter created in equal amounts
   in the Big Bang would have completely annihilated one another. Our
   universe would contain nothing but light—no homework, no schools…but
   also no people, or planets, or stars!

   Physicists long ago figured out something must have happened to explain
   the imbalance—and our very existence.

   "Our results will serve as a tough test for our current understanding
   of particle physics.”

   — Brookhaven theoretical physicist Taku Izubuchi

   “The fact that we have a universe made of matter strongly suggests that
   there is some violation of symmetry,” said Taku Izubuchi, a theoretical
   physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National
   Laboratory.

   The physicists call it charge conjugation-parity (CP) violation.
   Instead of everything in the universe behaving perfectly symmetrically,
   certain subatomic interactions happen differently if viewed in a mirror
   (violating parity) or when particles and their oppositely charged
   antiparticles swap each other (violating charge conjugation symmetry).
   Scientists at Brookhaven—James Cronin and Val Fitch—were the first to
   find evidence of such a symmetry “switch-up” in experiments conducted
   in 1964 at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, with additional
   evidence coming from experiments at CERN, the European Laboratory for
   Nuclear Research. Cronin and Fitch received the 1980 Nobel Prize in
   physics for this work.

   Theoretical physicists and kaon-decay calculators Norman Christ, Robert
   Mawhinney (both of Columbia University), and Taku Izubuchi (of
   Brookhaven), holding one rack of the QCDOC supercomputer at Brookhaven,
   which was used for many of the earlier kaon calculations. It was
   replaced by QCDCQ in 2012.

   What was observed was the decay of a subatomic particle known as a kaon
   into two other particles called pions. Kaons and pions (and many other
   particles as well) are composed of quarks. Understanding kaon decay in
   terms of its quark composition has posed a difficult problem for
   theoretical physicists.

   “That was the homework assignment handed to theoretical physicists, to
   develop a theory to explain this kaon decay process—a mathematical
   description we could use to calculate how frequently it happens and
   whether or how much it could account for the matter-antimatter
   imbalance in the universe. Our results will serve as a tough test for
   our current understanding of particle physics,” Izubuchi said.

Sophisticated computational tools

   The mathematical equations of Quantum Chromodynamics, or QCD—the theory
   that describes how quarks and gluons interact—have a multitude of
   variables and possible values for those variables. So the scientists
   needed to wait for supercomputing capabilities to evolve before they
   could actually solve them. The physicists invented the complex
   algorithms and wrote nifty software packages that some of the world’s
   most powerful supercomputers used to describe the quarks’ behavior and
   solve the problem.

   In the physicists’ software, the particles are “placed” on an imaginary
   four-dimensional space-time lattice consisting of three spatial
   dimensions plus time. At one end of the time dimension lies the kaon,
   made of two kinds of quarks—a “strange” quark and an “anti-down”
   quark—held together by gluons. At the opposite end, they place the end
   products, the four quarks that make up the two pions. Then the
   supercomputer computes how the kaon transforms into two pions as it
   flies through space and time. Conducting these computations on the
   lattice greatly simplifies the problem.

   Gene supercomputers at Brookhaven, the machines used for the kaon
   calculations

   “We use the supercomputers to look at how each quark is flying—its
   velocity, direction—in other words, the dynamics of the strong QCD
   interaction,” Izubuchi said.

   Somewhere in the middle of this complicated space-time grid, with some
   degree of probability, the strange quark of the kaon—which the strong
   force keeps strongly bound with its anti-down quark partner—suddenly
   starts to change into a down quark by the so-called electroweak
   interaction. Since a kaon is heavier than two pions, the energy
   released creates a new quark/anti-quark pair—an “up” and an “anti-up”
   quark—from the vacuum. These quarks then combine with the new down
   quark and the leftover anti-down quark to make the two pions.

   “The experiments showed how frequently these ‘K→ππ’ processes happen,
   but the part that violates CP symmetry is the strange quark converting
   into a down quark through the weak interaction,” Izubuchi said. “That’s
   the part we really wanted to know more about to understand the strength
   of this CP violation. That information will give us a hint of why the
   universe is matter-rich, and/or confirm the correctness of our current
   understanding of particle physics.”

   The supercomputers crunched tens of billions of numbers into the
   equation that describes this part of the process to find the result
   that should reproduce the decaying particle patterns and frequencies
   observed by the experiments.

   “The result of the calculation tells us how frequently this
   CP-violating weak interaction occurs and the strength of the CP
   violation at the quark level,” Izubuchi said. “It’s a kind of
   reverse-engineering what experimenters have seen in kaon decays to
   solve the problem.”

New algorithm, higher precision

   After publishing their [56]initial results in 2012, the physicists
   further improved their calculation to more closely simulate what
   happens with these particles in Nature. These new calculations allow
   them to directly compare their numbers with the experimental results
   more accurately, but they also increase the computational “cost”
   considerably—requiring more computing power/time. Even with the newest
   supercomputers, the homework would have taken many years if not for a
   new efficient algorithm developed by the Brookhaven group in late 2012.

   “This new algorithm, called all-mode averaging (AMA), divides the whole
   calculation into a ‘difficult’ but small piece and an ‘easier’ large
   piece, and devotes more computation time to the latter part to save the
   total computation required,” Izubuchi said. “It accelerates the speed
   of the computations by a factor of ten or more. This very simple idea
   of dividing the calculation into two pieces actually helped to reduce
   the statistical error of the computation by a lot.”

Do the numbers add up?

   Is the calculated strength of the weak interaction strong enough to
   account for the matter antimatter asymmetry in the early universe?

   “That’s the million-dollar question,” said Izubuchi. “So far people
   think this is not the full answer. We cannot explain why the universe
   is matter-rich based solely on the amount of CP violation that this
   kaon decay accounts for. So there may be other sources of CP violation
   other than the weak interaction that would be revealed if a discrepancy
   were found between our calculation and the experimental results.”

   Then Izubuchi confessed that the theorists have only solved half of
   their homework problem.

   “When we say we theoretically understood this process, it is only half
   true. There are two different ways the two end-result pions can combine
   with each other (called isospin states), and we’ve only solved the
   problem for one combination, the isospin 2 channel.”

   The experiments have measurements for both isospin states, so the
   theorists are working on calculating the second process as well.

   “The other, isospin 0, is more challenging, and we are getting there by
   employing the faster supercomputers and new theoretical ideas and
   computation algorithms. But, for now, we have finished half of 50
   years’ homework.”

   This research is part of DOE’s Scientific Discovery through Advanced
   Computing (SciDAC-3) program “Searching for Physics Beyond the Standard
   Model: Strongly-Coupled Field Theories at the Intensity and Energy
   Frontiers,” supported by the DOE Office of Science.

   The supercomputing resources used for this research included: QCDCQ, a
   pre-commercial version of the IBM Blue Gene supercomputers, located at
   the RIKEN/BNL Research Center—a center funded by the Japanese RIKEN
   laboratory in a cooperative agreement with Brookhaven Lab; a Blue
   Gene/Q supercomputer of the New York State Center for Computational
   Science, hosted by Brookhaven; half a rack of an additional Blue Gene/Q
   funded by DOE through the US based lattice QCD consortium, USQCD; a
   Blue Gene/Q machine at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre; the
   large installation of BlueGene/P (Intrepid) and Blue Gene/Q (Mira)
   machines at Argonne National Laboratory funded by the DOE Office of
   Science; and PC cluster machines at Fermi National Accelerator
   Laboratory and at RIKEN.
