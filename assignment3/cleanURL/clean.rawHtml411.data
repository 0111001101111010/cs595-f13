Attendees for "HTML5 CodeShow"

       Spinner

   We are a group of hackers/developers/tech enthusiasts who are ecstatic
   about what the future of the web and mobile apps will bring.
     * Hi everyone,
       Save the date, the 6th HTML5 CodeShow is coming up!
       It will, this time be at [13]Skype on the 14th of October.

       [14]Steven Goodwin will present an IRC client
       Web browsers talk to servers. Servers talk to other servers. And
       servers talk to databases. Why don't web browsers talk to other web
       browsers? Well, they can.
       With a few tricks here and there, you can implement full
       client-to-client communication in your own HTML5 apps. Steven will
       demonstrate this by writing an IRC example application live during
       his talk.

       We are still looking for speakers so if you would like to livecode
       something, feel free to contact me.

       Here is a quick presentation of the [15]fifth HTML5 CodeShow and
       here are the hashtags you can use : #HTML5 #CodeShow #London
