   A woman accused of hacking the internet system of Parliament’s
   operations officer appeared in the Bellville Specialised Commercial
   Crime Court in Cape Town on Wednesday.

   Cleopatra Mosana was not asked to plead to 33 alleged violations of
   legislation involving the protection of internet-related
   communications.

   Prosecutor Juan Agulhas told the court her lawyer, Greg Duncan, was in
   the process of making representations to his office for the withdrawal
   of the charges.

   The matter was postponed to November 15.

   Duncan asked that Mosana be excused from attending the November
   proceedings, as she now lived in Centurion.

   The magistrate said a warrant for her arrest would be authorised in the
   normal manner if she failed to attend.

   It would, however, only be executed if she again failed to attend the
   next hearing after the November one.

   According to the charge sheet, Mosana allegedly hacked Tango Lamani’s
   internet system between April and June, 2011.

   The charge sheet said Lamani had highly confidential and sensitive
   information, as well as personal information, stored on his
   parliamentary PC.

   The charge sheet said “hacking” was a term used by computer literates,
   and meant to gain access via the internet, into another system, without
   the authority or permission of the owner of the other system.

   According to the charge sheet, Parliament’s IT department informed
   Lamani that his system had been hacked.

   The charge sheet said Mosana was at that stage in the employ of home
   affairs in Cape Town, where one of the “infringing” computers was
   located.
