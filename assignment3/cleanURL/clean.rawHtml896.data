   It’s true: Some 70,000 people attended an arts-and-crafts fair in
   Manhattan this past weekend. They milled. They performed
   callous-building feats of manual creation. And they demoed soldering,
   sandblasting, quilting, farming, injection-molding and all manner of
   human endeavor that showcases the meeting of opposable thumbs with
   materials in space and time.

   It was the World Maker Faire, the roving “festival of invention,
   creativity and resourcefulness” that invites “[49]tech enthusiasts,
   crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs,
   authors, artists, students and commercial exhibitors” to show what
   they’ve made, and what they’ve been making. Even after seven years of
   these events, the exuberance of the Maker Faires is still discomfiting.
   Sure, this time things were a little less off-the-grid than in years
   past, despite all of the robots, drones and robots that make drones on
   display; but still, this year’s event was much more kid-friendly, with
   lots of neato colorful Build-a-Bear-style stuff that led many observers
   to wonder [50]whether the Portlandia-and-Brooklyn-grown maker culture
   might be going mainstream.

   IFRAME:
   [51]http://www.youtube.com/embed/_7VI2jlJEtE?list=PL60F0A7E4EA35A0F5

   Attendance at flagship Maker Faires and their many derivatives is up,
   visibility is up, and no one is declaring the Maker Faires “[52]over,”
   as they cyclically do with Burning Man and TechCrunch Disrupt. So why
   is this strain of culture, the tinkering class, the one that’s gone
   viral in 2013?

   It certainly was underpredicted. In fact, of all the imaginings of the
   future that proliferated in the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War and
   the birth of the Web, exactly none foresaw America’s youth returning to
   colonial folkways — darning, churning, butchering and smelting. In the
   '90s, if you were ambitious and 25, you were supposed to open a bagel
   franchise in pleasant downtown Bucharest (glasnost!) or launch an
   allergy-product dot-com empire called Atchoo or Snot.com, to compete
   with the failsafe San Francisco blockbuster [53]Gazoontite.com.

   But, if you’ll permit a brief review: The markets in former Sovietland
   never stabilized or became intelligible enough for morally squeamish
   American small businesses. At the same time, the dot-com bust turned
   websites — almost every single one of them — into [54]jokes, albeit
   necessary ones, which millennials were all too ready to abandon, for
   Facebook, mobile apps and almost anything with a lowercase “[55]i” or
   capital “[56]G” in front of it.

   Alas, children of the 1990s — the ones whose eyes on college
   commencement day had been trained on Russia and the early Web — failed
   to clock this shift. So even as we Gen-X types have given up on our
   Warsaw-condos plan, we still habitually identify digital opportunities
   with the Web — that commercial dot-com space. At the same time, the
   younger set sees the Web as itself now Iron Curtained by an
   all-too-stable oligopoly (Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Facebook, AOL) that
   offers little chance for smaller players to do profitable work that
   also satisfies a creative itch.

   Fortunately, the wily youth found something else, as they always do.
   Just as analog culture created digital culture, which then superseded
   it, digital culture — the Internet, the Web — created anti-digital
   culture: hands-on, 3D, live, DIY culture, which may yet leave it in the
   dust.

   The hallmark of that culture is not that it rejects technology. Rather,
   it is fundamentalist about tech. It reclaims the “techne”
   (“craftsmanship”) in technology and turns the main event for
   participants into “making” and not “publishing” or “marketing” or
   “disrupting.” Maker culture is impatient with the 2D aspect of digital
   technology, favoring the 3D printing that is its sine qua non. (This
   year the Maker Faire debuted some one zillion iPhone covers printed in
   three dimensions.)

   The earlier phase of digital culture made a fetish of the mind,
   abstraction and “ideas” (as in TED’s “ideas worth spreading”). It
   invented a new philosophy and social science — neuroscience — to
   enshrine those things. By contrast, this phase has as its totem the
   hands — and the newly available and cheap “tools of the industrial
   revolution,” as Mark Hatch, the former Navy Seal and CEO of TechShop
   puts it in “[57]The Maker Movement Manifesto.” Hands and tools
   together, it turns out, can do tremendous things: It seems like a
   revelation after all the airy TED talks about dreams, ideas and the
   lovey right brain.

   Maker culture, then, is an inspired cultural response to the widespread
   stress of digitization. Maker avatars may seem like digital natives,
   but they identify as farmers, steelworkers, carpenters and tinkerers.
   Some of their companies — like MakerBot, the world’s most famous seller
   of personal 3D printers — [58]actually sell for a profit. But profit is
   not the goal: Makers tend to say they’re knitting or soldering mostly
   to play, to invent and to help. And, occasionally, to build their own
   drones.

   People making stuff with machines — who knows what can happen?
