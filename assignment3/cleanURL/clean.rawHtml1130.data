       I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW PLEASED I AM WITH ALL YOUR BRUSHES

    "I was really excited and I must say that after seeing everything you
   have created I am really impressed. I cannot express enough how pleased
    I am with all your brushes. Thanks again for sharing your talent with
                                    me."

                                 Juanita M.


                    Silvia Dear fellow graphics designer,

    If you are tired of taking too long to create great graphics because
   your existing Photoshop© brushes are not all you wish they were, then
        this will be the most exciting message you've read for ages.

   Hi, my name is Silvia Bukovac Gasevic and, probably like you are now, I
     used to be frustrated beyond words, struggling to come up with good
     quality graphic designs, on time and within budget. Finally, after
     being unable to find anything that was good enough, I'd had enough.


   So I decided to devote my spare time to creating my very own Photoshop©
     brushes. And I was so pleased with my first creation, I decided to
        create some more. So it wasn't very long before I had quite a
                                 collection.


                   And here's the really interesting part


   I found that, by using my own Photoshop© brushes, not only did my own
   productivity at work increase dramatically, but I was also getting some
   great feedback from my delighted clients. And this obviously didn't go
                         unnoticed in the boardroom.


      Because it wasn't very long before I was offered the prestigious
   position of Art Director. And, although I can't name the company, when
    I tell you our clients included such illustrious brands as Swatch and
            Rolex, you can guess it was a job well worth having!


     But it wasn't only the board of directors who noticed my increased
   levels of design and productivity... my work colleagues weren't slow on
                         picking up on this, either.


     And so they wanted to use my sets of brushes, too. What's more they
   came up with requests for more new sets. And I'd also found my brushes
        helped me win some pretty high end design competitions, too.


                          Here are some examples...

   American Design Award Winner
   [6]American Design Award Winner Designer of the Month
   [7]Designer of the Month !Portfolios.com Web Design Award Winner
   [8]Portfolios.com Web Design Award Winner

  So it wasn't long before there was a vacancy for an Art Director... again!


   That's because so many of my colleagues and even total strangers were
   clamoring to buy my sets of brushes. So I decided I needed to devote
   all my time and energy to doing this - and creating more sets of
   brushes.


      And my brushes have been featured in these top quality magazines...

   Advanced Photoshop Magazine, UK, May 2008 Advanced Photoshop Magazine,
   FR, June 2008 Digital Arts Magazine, UK, June 2008
   Advanced Photoshop Magazine Advanced Photoshop Magazine Digital Arts
   Magazine



    And now, at last, YOU TOO can enjoy the kudos of turning heads with your
     designs, as well as increasing your own productivity like gangbusters.


   So just imagine getting bigger and better commissions AND being able to
   complete them in record time. That means you'll have the freedom to
   choose either more leisure time, or make even more money from your
   increased productivity - or a mixture of both.

    Either way, it's never too soon to start enjoying the good life!



So let me give you just a tiny taster of all the goodies I have for you in this
                     quite awesome 800+ MEGA collection...

   And these brushes are perfect for any graphic design project, including...

                            * scrapbook projects
                         * web page design projects
                           * video design projects
                            * commercial projects
                       * any other visual art project

   ... that's because creating top quality is my obsession, which is why
   they are BIG enough for any project you care to name. That means you
   get crisp, top quality on every project - no matter what size you need
   or what medium the design is for... posters... magazines... books... or
   web sites.



But don't take my word for that, read what my regular client, Jo, says about the
advantage of using my big brushes...


  THEY MAKE WHAT I CREATE LOOK BRILLIANT AND DON'T
  GO BLURRED AND OUT OF FOCUS LIKE SOME BRUSHES DO

     "I love the size of your brushes. They make what I create look
     brilliant and don't go blurred and out of focus like some brushes
     do. I will be buying more for sure."

     Jo P.


    And my aim isn't to create brushes that are merely good. To be in my
    collection they must be top quality. But - again - don't just take my word
    for that, read what another of my regular clients, Pattie, says about the
    quality...


  I'M THRILLED WITH THE QUALITY OF YOUR BRUSHES

     "Again I have purchased one of your marvelous sets, again I’m
     thrilled with the quality of your brushes, and again I appreciate
     your reasonable priced commercial use items! I thought you might
     like a peek at what I used the new Shamrock brushes for this week.
     Thank you over and over and over again for sharing your talent!"

     Pattie K.


    And - because these brushes are good enough to play with the big boys, you
    get a full commercial use licence.

    And - above all - these designs are not just good... they are great! But
    don't take my word on that, either, read what just a couple of our delighted
    clients say...


  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THEM!

     "I just purchased a few brush sets and I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!!!!
     Keep up the good work. I’ll be back for more!"

     Bonnie B.

  YOUR STUFF IS AWESOME

     "Your stuff is awesome! I’m sure I’ll be back!
     Thanks."

     Elise H.

                          I know what you're thinking


    You can already see how these stunning collections can help you take your
    design expertise to a an effortless new level, as well as slashing the time
    you take to do it all. And I bet you've also realized how this massive range
    of designs can explode your inspiration and quickly lift you out of the
    doldrums of "designer's block".


   But, you're also wondering just how much a high quality and very
   comprehensive collection will cost you. Well, before I reveal that, I
   want to make something even more important very clear.


                          I take all the risk on this.


   You see, I know just how good these brushes are, but it's really
   something that's impossible to convey on a web site. So you really need
   to experience the joy and simplicity of using them - just like the rest
   of our delighted clients. So...


  ...take a test drive for a full sixty days. And, if at any time, you feel
  these brushes aren't bringing an explosion in the quality and productivity of
  your work, just shoot me an email and I'll refund your payment the very same
  day. Fair enough?


   Now let me tell you why there are a total of 24 different sets of
   brushes. Because we found that our clients were so delighted with their
   purchases, they were always coming back for more sets at $10 a time.
   All of which was a shame, because it meant much of the time my designs
   were saving them was spent ordering more sets of brushes.


                  Then it struck me like a bolt of lightening!


   If I bundled up our 24 best selling sets of brushes, I'd save my valued
   client's time. What's more, they would have our very best designs all
   there, at the click of a mouse to either inspire them with
   morning-fresh design ideas or instantly get on with a new project
   without losing that vital spark of inspiration because they had to come
   to our site to order another set of brushes.

   What's more, because we've slashed our accounting costs by cutting out
   all the hundreds of little bitty single set orders there's a massive
   cost saving I'm happy to pass on to you in full.

    So, instead of paying nearly $10 a set, you get them for LESS THAN HALF THAT
    PRICE. That means - instead of paying $239.76 for all 24 sets you pay just
    $119.98 PLUS you get all the convenience - and inspiration - of having all
    the designs right there, at your fingertips, ready to instantly produce
    another sparkling design in record time! But wait, there's more.


             Because - I'm also giving you these awesome bonuses...
