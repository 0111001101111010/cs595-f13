   Frank’s Career in Three Song Titles

   (09/20/2013)
   A Life in Song small


   Attempting to choose songs from Frank Sinatra’s play list to be used in
   a concert is a monumental task. Sinatra recorded over 1500 songs, a
   gargantuan sum, so trying to limit yourself to a couple hour’s worth is
   daunting, but today you’re going to learn about Frank’s career in only
   three song titles.


   His hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey was where he began with employment
   as a delivery person, then a shipyard worker, but music was his passion
   and he scraped away with various gigs until he attracted the attention
   of bandleader, Tommy Dorsey, which brings us to the first song: From
   this Moment On. The Cole Porter song appeared on the album, A Swingin’
   Affair, and with this taste of the big time, there was not going to be
   any looking back for Sinatra.


   Frank’s appeal to the bobby soxers put him at the top of the popular
   music world and his unparalleled success continued until his mid 30s
   when age, a vocal cord haemorrhage, and the spiral of self-doubt and
   depression led to him being dropped by Columbia and MCA as a recording
   artist, which brings us to a song recorded with Dorsey, The Sky Fell
   Down.


   You can’t keep a good man down, as the saying goes, and Sinatra
   excelled at many things, so it was his Academy Award winning
   performance in the 1953 film, From Here to Eternity that takes us to
   the song of the same name. His career was back; making this title
   prophetic, ensuring Sinatra will be with us for eternity.


   Rick Michel has been working hard on a new project encompassing the
   life of Frank Sinatra in song, an ambitious and significant undertaking
   that is certain to interest anyone with a musical ear, so stay tuned to
   Rick’s site and make sure you are following him on [21]Twitter and
   [22]Facebook for all the news.


   Take a few moments this day to enjoy these tunes while reflecting on
   Frank’s career. These, like so many of Sinatra’s songs, trumpet love,
   but the titles are poignant entries for this reflection.
