       What really impressed me in this webinar was your explanation of
       the “black hole” and how Human Resources is really attempting to
       screen you out rather than screen you in. Learning the methods and
       techniques to bypass Human Resources and get direct access to the
       hiring manager is critical. I feel that through your training I
       have learned to get interviews I never would have gotten.

       I have found Job Coach Live to be a real game changer. I learned
       ways I never even thought possible to find the hiring managers
       names within companies plus their contact information and how to
       approach them. This job market is so competitive that I feel the
       training that Job Coach Live offers gives me a huge advantage
       03/2013
     * ~ M. Wassik
       I realized the 9 essential job search tools are absolutely
       necessary for the serious job seeker to land an interview with the
       hiring manager. These 9 Essential tools make the job search process
       so much more effective. I look forward to the upcoming Q&A
       webinars. Best Regards,
       04/2013

   Stop! - Don’t Just Apply to the Career Website “Black Hole"!

   Your resume is lost with thousands of others and you never find out if
   it was even viewed.  Online Human Resources are trying to screen you
   Out – Not In.


   Get your resume viewed by the Hiring Manager using the practical
   approach of Executive Recruiters.

   In today’s world jobseekers need to stand out to be noticed.


   Learn the insider secrets that get the Hiring Manager’s attention and
   the jobseekers interviews.  You will shave months off of your job
   search.

   You Only Have Six Seconds

   Six seconds is the average time a resume is first viewed by Human
   Resource Recruiters

   And this is only if you have the right keywords in your cover letter
   and resume.  Job Coach Live will show you how to pass the Human
   Resource Recruiter’s scrutiny test by tailoring or customizing your
   resume and cover letter to the company’s job description.

   With this knowledge you will increase the odds of your resume being
   viewed by the company Human Resource Recruiter.  HR recruiters are
   overloaded with the hundreds to thousands of resumes they have to
   choose from daily. They look for keywords to streamline their selection
   process through the mass of resumes they receive.


   Who is the Company Behind the Blind Ad?

   Companies don’t want to be inundated with resumes for their open
   positions they have and often will use blind ads to limit their
   accessibility.

   Learn the techniques Executive Recruiters use to find out the name of
   the company advertising a job through a blind ad.

   With this knowledge you will be first in line to the hiring manager
   (Future Boss). Very few job-seekers know this method and you will be
   able to demonstrate why you stand out from all the other job seekers.

   Join the professionals, do it our way and get hired with the Job Coach
   Live job search method!
