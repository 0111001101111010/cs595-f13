   [19]Valve announces third-party Steam Machines, which will land in 2014

   Valve announces third-party Steam Machines, which will land in 2014

   Hot on the heels of the announcement of its own Linux-based operating
   system, [20]SteamOS, computer game developer and distributor Valve has
   announced a range of SteamOS gaming computers called Steam Machines.
   The machines will be built by other companies with the aim of bringing
   PC gaming firmly into the living room.

   The announcement is the latest twist in the ongoing Steam Box saga.
   Though the [21]Steam Box name was never used by Valve, the company was
   known to be developing its own gaming hardware to run PC games acquired
   and managed using Steam, its own games distribution, management
   software and social network.

   Following this latest announcement it seems Valve's hardware efforts to
   date will culminate in Steam Machine prototypes. The company says that
   it will distribute 300 prototypes to chosen Steam Users before the end
   of the year. Among the requirements for eligibility are having 10
   friends on Steam, and playing a game using a gamepad in Steam's Big
   Picture mode.

   The company says that a number of Steam Machines will be available in
   2014, with different models optimized for different users. "The
   specific machine we're testing is designed for users who want the most
   control possible over their hardware," Valve says. "Other boxes will
   optimize for size, price, quietness, or other factors."

   The big question at this stage is who will make the Steam Machines?
   Though Valve's lips are sealed at this point, [22]Wired notes a
   concurrent press release from Nvidia emphasizes the company's
   involvement with SteamOS. With [23]Project Shield, Nvidia has already
   demonstrated its willingness to develop stand-alone gaming hardware,
   and it would appear to be a strong candidate as a potential Steam
   Machine manufacturer.

   Addressing gamer concerns on being forced to use a certain type of
   input device, Valve says that users will be free to use a mouse and
   keyboard, but reasserted its position that gamepads work well with
   Steam and SteamOS. Most intriguingly, the company said it will shortly
   say more on the subject of input, which raises the possibility of a
   novel input device. Watch this space.

   Youtube is all abuzz with the tech reviewers about this. Most of them
   don't really get it I think. Yes, the average consumer will be confused
   by multiple configurations from multiple venders, but Valve will set a
   minimum and so every steambox will be able to play a base set of games,
   and developers will make their games run for that spec. Valve will
   probably set a few standards, I'm guessing, bronze, silver, and gold,
   or whatever. When Valve updates the specs the top tier will become the
   middle, the middle the lower, and the lowest will need to be upgraded
   to get into a tier. The point is the specs will be upgraded in a
   shorter span of 10 years so in a few years the steambox spec will blow
   the consoles out of the water. They'll also be upgradeable, so it won't
   be a huge investment. Also, games won't be $60-$70, they'll actually
   come down in price. What you save in games will pay for a nice upgrade
   down the road.
