   Excavations of an ancient synagogue found in a city where Mary
   Magdalene is thought to have lived have thrown up clues about how the
   Jewish and Christian religions developed.

   Jewish artefacts found at the site in Migdal on the shore of the Sea of
   Galilee - previously known as Magdala - include a table carved with a
   Menorah, yet the temple itself, as well as a coin, discovered on the
   site dates back to the time of Jesus and the rise of Christianity in
   the region.

   Archaeologists believe this combination suggests Jews and Christians
   may have once used the holy site to worship together, according to
   Israeli news site [28]Haaretz, and it could lead to discoveries about
   how and when Jesus and Magdalene met.

   The synagogue ruins, pictured, were first uncovered in 2009 and they
   are thought to date back around 2,000 years. The mixture of Jewish
   artefacts and a coin found from 29AD - a year before Jesus is said to
   have arrived in the area - suggests Jews and Judeo-Christians may have
   once used the holy site to worship together

WHY IS MIGDAL SIGNIFICANT?

   Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala, situated on
   the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount
   Arbel.

   Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene, one of
   Jesus' most loyal followers.

   She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her
   name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'.

   Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when
   Magdalene first met and began following Jesus.

   The synagogue was first uncovered in 2009 dating back to the 1st
   Century - around 2,000 years ago.

   It measures 11 x 11 metres, and the walls of the room plus the six
   columns that supported the ceiling, which was probably made of wooden
   beams and mortar, would have been covered with frescoes painted in
   seven colours including dark red, yellow and blue panels in black and
   white frames.

   The excavation revealed the synagogue was renovated in around 40 of 50
   C.E, before being abandoned shortly before 68 C.E.

   This year is significant because it was the time of the Great Revolt of
   the Jews against the Romans.

   Archaeologists have also uncovered various Jewish artefacts, which
   Haaretz describes as 'firsts in archaeological excavations, in Israel
   and even worldwide.'

   However, a coin found on the site dated back to 29 A.D - a year before
   Jesus is said to have arrived in the area and four years before his
   crucifixion - making it potentially a location of interest for
   Christianity as well.

   Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala, situated on
   the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount
   Arbel. Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene.

   Magdalene is described as one of Jesus' most loyal followers and it is
   also thought she was one of the first people to speak to him after his
   resurrection.

   She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her
   name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'.

   However, there is no direct connection with Mary and the town of
   Magdala in the bible.

   Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when
   Magdalene first met and began following Jesus.

   Father Juan Maria Solana, director of the Magdala Center told Public
   Radio International: From the Jewish point of view, the position is
   clear; it’s a first-century synagogue.
   The dig at Magdala is being carried out by archaeologist Dina
   Avshalom-Gorni and Arfan Najar in collaboration with Marcela Zapata.

   The dig is being carried out by archaeologist Dina Avshalom-Gorni and
   Arfan Najar with Marcela Zapata. They are hoping to find clues as to
   how and when Jesus came to the town and met Magdalene. The project is
   being underwritten by the Ark New Gate Company, which is building the
   Magdala Center, pictured

   'From the Christian point of view, we cannot doubt that Jesus would
   have been there sometime.

   Yet Marcela Zapata, from the Anáhuac University of Southern Mexico City
   told on The Huffington Post: 'there is no archaeological evidence to
   prove Jesus ever set foot inside.'

   The dig at Magdala is co-directed by Israel Antiquities archaeologist
   Dina Avshalom-Gorni and Arfan Najar in collaboration with Marcela
   Zapata from the Anáhuac University of Southern Mexico City.

   It is being underwritten by the Ark New Gate Company, which is building
   the nearby Magdala Center.

   "there is no archaeological evidence to prove Jesus ever set foot
   inside" In fact, there is no archaeological evidence anywhere that
   Jesus actually existed. - Samphire, Guildford, 26/09/2013 12:37
   Actually there is historical evidence in the form of roman warrants and
   documents to suggest that Jesus was a real man and that he was a
   carpenter from Nazareth, also that he was crucified by Ponticus pilot
   and on the third day he was buried, so go suck on that

   Not highly surprising. The earliest Christians were basically a
   denomination or sect of Judaism. They didn't become a fully distinct
   religion until a couple centuries later.

   Derr, a lot of 'Christians' still believe that Jesus is from the West!!
   The Lord is One! We are supposed to worship the same God, but Judaism
   is from works and keeping all the laws and Christianity is by the grace
   of God. Jesus Christ fulfilled all the laws and the prophecies.

   Jesus claimed to be the son of god, and demanded that everyone worship
   him. Whether thats true or not is one thing, but everyone can agree
   that he was the ultimate narcisist.

   If you knew anything, you'd realise people FOLLOWED Jesus, and he said
   'no one comes to the father except through me'....he gave himself up to
   be crucified so we'd be forgiven for our sinful existence as mortals,
   and not condemned for all eternity

   Our Lord Christ (and the prophets) have absolutely nothing to do with
   the liars, their father is the devil the lord of lies and they've been
   liars and deceivers from the beginning, there is not a shred of truth
   in them, they're Greek (and then Roman) usurpers and they had been for
   centuries before the blessed Lord...

GADGET REVIEWS

   [249]Gadget review: Skullcandy Crusher Headphones
   [250]The Crusher does exactly what it says on the tin. Unleash an
   unrelenting torrent of deep bass through your eardrums. Be warned,
   these are not for the faint-hearted.

   [251]Gadget review: Klipsch Image X7i in-ear headphones with 3-button
   control
   [252]The Klipsch X7i headphones are nearly perfect. Nearly. The sound
   is excellent - and in headphones, that's 90 per cent of the battle won.
   Just some blips hold them back.

   [253]Gadget review: Samsung Galaxy S4 phone
   [254]At the end of July Samsung overtook Apple to become the world's
   most profitable mobile phone company. We look at the S4 to see why it's
   so popular.

   [255]Gadget of the week: Lepow Moonstone 6000 mobile power bank
   [256]Ever been out and about and your phone's run out of juice? Of
   course you have. The Lepow Moonstone 6000mAh portable powerbank could
   be a lifesaver.

   [257]Yurbuds Ironman Series headphones
   [258]The selling point of the Yurbuds are that they don't fall out.
   Which on the face of it, given that headphones are meant to stay in
   your ears, doesn't seem that big a deal.

   [259]Gadget of the week: Kansi 9twenty folding bike
   [260]Feast your eyes on the Kansi 9twenty - one of a range of four
   bikes on the market in the UK - highly functional and fab looking. Well
   worth the asking price.

   [261]Philips In Sight wireless home monitor
   [262]The Philips In Sight wireless home monitor is a brilliant way of
   keeping track of your home. Place it in any room and watch a live video
   feed from your smartphone.

   [263]Sennheiser Momentum over-ear headphones
   [264]Quality comes at a price, but not as much as youd think. The
   Momentums blend state-of-the-art design and materials with cutting-edge
   sound.

   [265]Philips ActionFit sports headband
   [266]I've always been skeptical about sports headphones that aren't
   in-ear. The pairs I have owned have either been uncomfortable or too
   loose.

   [267]WeSC Piston headphones
   [268]At £40, these WeSC Piston headphones seem somewhat of a bargain.
   Sadly, although their looks will win over fans, audio sounds muffled
   whatever the volume.

   [269]LifeProof iPhone case
   [270]Cracking your iPhone screen is one of the most annoying things you
   can do. Thankfully, the new LifeProof iPhone case will make this a
   thing of the past.
