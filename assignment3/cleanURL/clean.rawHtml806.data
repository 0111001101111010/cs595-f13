            College students who major in physical sciences tend to be
            smarter than those who major in psychology, judging from the
            [187]2013 SAT Report on College & Career Readiness from the
            College Board.
            The report includes data on SAT scores by intended major for
            the college-bound class of 2013. We've taken the liberty of
            ranking majors based on these scores, which are the best
            commonly available proxy for intelligence. Although the
            results are somewhat limited, seeing as different majors
            require different skills and anyway the SAT is not a perfect
            test, some notable trends emerge.
            Multi/interdisciplinary studies students have the highest
            combined scores, which makes sense since they need a wide
            array of talents and are likely to be either ambitious double
            majors or intellectual scholars.
            Physical science majors (physics, chemistry, etc.) have the
            second highest combined scores; naturally they tend to be
            serious students, bravely embarking into fields where B.S. is
            not an option.
            A large group of undecided students beat out the similarly
            ruminative Philosophy majors by one point, claiming the tenth
            highest combined score.
            As we go down the ranking of combined scores, there are
            increasingly technical majors — these students aren't wasting
            their time with a liberal arts education.
            Here's a ranking by combined scores:
            smartest majors
            Based on data from [188]research.collegeboard.org
            Now, a ranking of majors by critical reading score. Naturally,
            the humanities subjects rise higher, but check out that
            still-impressive score for physical science majors:
            smartest majors reading
            Based on data from [189]research.collegeboard.org
            Next, a ranking of majors by math scores — and the winner is
            ... math majors.
            smartest majors math
            Based on data from [190]research.collegeboard.org
            Finally, a ranking of majors by writing
            score. Multi/interdisciplinary scores win here too.
            smartest majors writing
            Based on data from [191]research.collegeboard.org
            Now what happens when we add attractiveness to the equation?

            intelligence among professors
