   The iPhone 5S was [106]released to the general public on Friday. Little
   more than 48 hours later, a group of hackers found a way to bypass the
   device's fingerprint-based security system that doesn't
   involve [107]messy decapitation.

   The [108]Chaos Computer Club's Starbug was able to get past the
   iPhone's 5S TouchID security system by using a photo of your
   fingerprint and using glue or plastic to create a copy, like you've
   seen in countless spy movies. He modified existing biometric hacking
   methods slightly for the iPhone's TouchID. "In reality, Apple's sensor
   has just a higher resolution compared to the sensors so far. So we only
   needed to ramp up the resolution of our fake," Starbug says.
