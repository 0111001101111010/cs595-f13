   One of my biggest pet peeves is people who "like" to play golf but get
   frustrated when they don't strike the ball well.

   This, I feel, is a case of self induced ignorance. Before all the hacks
   and duffers get their panties in a bunch over that last sentence let me
   explain.

   It's a misconception that golf lessons have to cost an arm and a leg
   and take up a bunch of your time every week or month. This is true, if
   you're trying to become some level of pro or maybe trying to win a club
   championship or something of that nature.

   For the average Joe/Jane it takes a conscious effort with just a couple
   lessons. If you enjoy the game so much, wouldn't you enjoy it more if
   you could at the very least strike the ball solid every swing? It
   doesn't have to go exceptionally straight, but striking the ball well
   is where you need to start. Here's how the casual player can do it:

   Get two lessons per year: one in the early spring and one mid summer
   (this is for the upper mid western golfer, who has 6 less months of
   golfer than those who live in the south). This will tune up any tics or
   inconsistencies you have in your swing.

   The other thing casual players can do to help themselves is to get to
   the course a good half hour before their tee time. Why? Track runners
   don't just get in the blocks and go, no, they warm up a little. Any
   athlete warms up before playing a sport. Golf is not a job, it's a
   sport, warm up and play well.

   If the casual golfer shows up to the course early and practices the
   things that their instructors have given them, they'll shoot much
   better and have a lot more fun doing it.

   So please hackers, duffers, hookers and slicers get a lesson, spend a
   couple hours a month practicing what you've learned and help yourself
   and other golfers around you have a more enjoyable time on the links.
