Genetic Study Pushes Back Timeline for First Significant Human Population
Expansion

   Sep. 24, 2013  About 10,000 years ago, the Neolithic age ushered in
   one of the most dramatic periods of human cultural and technological
   transition, where independently, different world populations developed
   the domestication of plants and animals. The hunter-gatherers gave rise
   to herders and farmers. Changes to a more sedentary lifestyle and
   larger settlements are widely thought to have contributed to a
   worldwide human population explosion, from an estimated 4-6 million
   people to 60-70 million by 4,000 B.C.

   Now, researchers Aiméa, et al., have challenged this assumption using a
   large set of populations from diverse geographical regions (20
   different genomic regions and mitochondrial DNA of individuals from 66
   African and Eurasian populations), and compared their genetic results
   with archaeological findings. The dispersal and expansion of Neolithic
   culture from the Middle East has recently been associated with the
   distribution of human genetic markers.

   They conclude that the first significant expansion of human populations
   appears to be much older than the emergence of farming and herding,
   dating back to the Paleolithic (60,000-80,000 years ago) rather than
   Neolithic age. Therefore, hunter-gatherer populations were able to
   thrive with cultural and social advances that allowed for the
   expansion. The authors also speculate that this Paleolithic human
   population expansion may be linked to the emergence of newer, more
   advanced hunting technologies or a rapid environmental change to dryer
   climates.

   Finally, they also suggest that strong Paleolithic expansions may have
   favored the emergence of sedentary farming in some populations during
   the Neolithic. Indeed, the authors also demonstrate that the
   populations who adopted a sedentary farming lifestyle during the
   Neolithic had previously experienced the strongest Paleolithic
   expansions. Conversely, contemporary nomadic herder populations in
   Eurasia experienced moderate Paleolithic expansions, and no expansions
   were detected for nomadic hunter-gatherers in Africa. "Human
   populations could have started to increase in Paleolithic times, and
   strong Paleolithic expansions in some populations may have ultimately
   favored their shift toward agriculture during the Neolithic," said
   Aiméa.
