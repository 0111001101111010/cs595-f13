   LAW AT LUNCH - LOOKING AFTER DEPENDENT PARENTS - DEALING WITH THE LEGAL
   ISSUES
   Our parents took care of us and we take care of our children. That's
   the usual assumption about how things should go. However, sometimes our
   parents, (or other adults we know), lose the legal capacity to make
   their own decisions and we've called on to assume this responsibility.
   This Presentation is an opportunity to learn about the legal issues
   involved in these situations and the options available to address them.
   Areas for discussion include:
     * Determining when capacity is lost - how does this happen and is the
       loss always total?
     * When are guardians or trustees needed and how are they appointed?
     * What parts do personal directives and enduring powers of attorney
       play?
     * How can accountability and libility issues be addressed?
