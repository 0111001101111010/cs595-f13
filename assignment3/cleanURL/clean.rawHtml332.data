   [21]Zumba fitness is a Latin dance program that mixes international
   music and contagious body movements to create a series of routines that
   are performed in a social dancing atmosphere.  Beto Perez created Zumba
   fitness while teaching an aerobic class in Colombia using salsa and
   merengue music, instead of the classical aerobics music. The following
   are some ways showing how Zumba can help you lose weight.

   Zumba fitness provides an opportunity to attain physical fitness
   without the strain and sacrifice of strenuous physical activity with a
   well implemented set of body routines in a joyful and party-like
   atmosphere. You have to be aware that physical activity increments the
   burning of calories (fat) in your body; therefore, it is important to
   keep a regular record of the burned calories and the daily intake, as
   well.

   You may start you weight lost program by beginning a Zumba-toning class
   which combines body-sculpting exercises and cardio work aimed at the
   burning off of calories. You may practice this program for thirty
   minutes a day for the first week, placing emphasis at your weight lost
   objectives. You have to maintain a balance, so as not to over exercise
   your body and lose more calories than you intake. Maintaining your
   energy levels is important to attain success.

   Following the second week of your weight lost program, you may begin to
   perform more demanding dance routines of a Zumba class.  This time you
   may begin to increment the time of practice as you see fit.  It is very
   important to maintain your body hydrated during your dance workouts;
   the amounts of water depend primarily on your physical complexion and
   routinely activities. Always drink sufficient amounts of water to
   maintain the airways of the nose and throat moist enough.

   On the third week, you may begin with the most explosive dance routines
   of a Zumba class. At this stage, you may have already attained an
   excellent control of your body´s metabolism. And your daily intake of
   calories might have attained equilibrium with your daily lost of
   calories which is the objective of your program. From now on, the dance
   routines and body movements may be changed to the more vigorous ones.
   Let your heart beat reach its normal level between sessions. It is very
   important to maintain a written record of your progress.

   The benefits of a dance workout are varied, and they might include the
   burn off of calories, tonification of various parts of the body,
   strengthening of muscles, flexibility, among many others. Maintaining a
   healthy nutritious diet during your endeavor will help you obtain the
   best results.
