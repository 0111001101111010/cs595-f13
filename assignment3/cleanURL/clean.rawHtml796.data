   Average scores on the nation's most widely used college entrance exams
   barely budged this year, raising anew concerns that today's high school
   graduates will be unprepared to compete in a global marketplace.

   In a report out today, the non-profit College Board says just 43% of
   SAT takers in the high school class of 2013 earned a score that
   indicates they will succeed in the first year of college. That
   percentage has remained "virtually unchanged" for at least five years,
   said Cyndie Schmeiser, chief of assessment for the College Board, based
   in New York.

   Last month, an annual report by the Iowa-based non-profit ACT found
   that just 26% of high school graduates in the class of 2013 met college
   readiness benchmarks in all four of the subjects its tests cover:
   English, reading, math and science. That's up from 25% last year and
   23% five years ago, but far too low, ACT chief executive officer Jon
   Whitmore said. "As a nation, we must set ambitious goals and take
   strong action to address this consistent problem."

   Reports for both tests sounded familiar themes: Low-income and minority
   students on average are less likely to be ready for college, though the
   percentage of black and Hispanic SAT takers who achieved scores
   indicating college readiness increased.

   David Coleman, who was named College Board president last fall, said
   the persistently stagnant numbers are "a call to action."

   "With our country struggling to compete in a global marketplace and
   millions of skilled jobs left unfilled here at home, it is essential to
   ensure that our students are prepared for college and careers," the
   College Board report says.
