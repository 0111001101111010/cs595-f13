   A brand’s database is arguably their most valuable asset for their
   ongoing marketing efforts. A rich data set that accurately profiles a
   brand’s target market allows for tailored 1 to 1 communication,
   enabling personal communication with each of your market segments. To
   effectively develop a rich set for each of their market segments,
   brands need to develop new ways of capturing the contact information of
   their target market.

   Most consumers will only provide their contact details via a HTML
   contact form when they are ready to buy, a huge problem for marketers
   as it does not allow brands to influence their decision making process.

   Offer something your users will perceive as valuable

   To obtain contact information about potential consumers, brands need to
   entice potential customers to exchange their contact details for
   something valuable, like an eBook for example. To drive site visitors
   to these forms, brands need to utilise calls to action on their website
   and blog and with banners strategically placed throughout their site.
   The objective here is to make it as easy as possible for visitors to
   enter their details via a HTML contact form in exchange for some
   valuable information or a coupon of some sort.

   To optimise your conversion rates, try experimenting with your calls to
   action.

   Try using “get us to call you back” instead of “contact us”, for
   example. The objective is to entice users to enter their contact
   details via your HTML contact form. Experiment with your calls to
   action and discover the most effective combination as possible.

   Once a potential consumer submits their details, make contact with them
   immediately.

   Research has shown that if contact is made with a potential consumer
   within 1 minute of them completing a HTML contact form, the chance of
   them converting into a paying customer skyrockets by 391%. It is vital
   to ensure that all contact detail submissions are sent to an email
   address that is under constant surveillance so that you can make
   contact with them as soon as possible. If a phone call is not possible
   make sure that you at least send a follow up email. Marketing
   automation platforms such as Ensight allow you to automate the follow
   up email.

   It is important that your HTML contact form doesn’t require too much
   information

   Consumers will be hesitant to provide too much of their details or will
   be deterred due to the amount of effort required to submit their
   details. Avoid using validation such as the popular CAPTCHA text block,
   as it also deters users from completing the form. That being said, you
   need to find a balance, as you still want to obtain information from
   the people completing the form that can help you with the market
   segmentation process.

   Test your forms and landing pages.

   Your landing pages and contact forms should be viewed as on-going
   projects that can be fine-tuned to convert as many visitors as possible
   into paying customers. The beauty of using a marketing automation
   system like Ensight is that you can continually optimise your landing
   pages and forms without an IT team or developer.

   Profiling should be viewed as a long term process.

   Once you have acquired your potential consumer’s contact details, you
   are guaranteeing a future opportunity to engage with them and to gather
   more in-depth information about their preferences. Instead of requiring
   people to enter a lot of details into a form upfront, rather design a
   communication programme that slowly captures data over a period of
   time.

    HTML contact forms are must for your website if you want to
   substantially grow your consumer database. By offering a piece of
   premium content you can further entice users to submit their contact
   details.
