   Before I start, I need to give some personal background on why I’m
   writing this article, so please excuse the long intro.

   You should know that I’m not a feminist. I’m far from it. But I am glad
   I live in a country where, as a girl, I wasn’t denied opportunities I
   wanted. Despite stats showing women don’t have a dominant role in tech,
   I feel that if a woman wants to work as a developer or be a leader in
   technology, she should go to school, get educated, be smart enough to
   get hired, and work her way up the ladder like any male would have to
   do. No pity parties. My [20]favorite statement so far on this subject
   is by Deanna Ballew who, after giving hope-downing statistics on women
   in tech says, frankly:

     What do the numbers mean? Well, if you’re a woman who wants to be in
     the tech industry, they should mean absolutely nothing… Whether
     you’re a woman or man, your success in the tech industry is going to
     come down to the same factors: Are you really good at what you do?
     Can you get the job done?

   I couldn’t agree more.

   But I have to admit, in the tech world, even if the pay rate is the
   same, there is an insecurity I feel as a female when I walk into sales
   meetings or sit in on talks at WordCamp (where everyone presumes I’m a
   blogger or a designer). I call myself a web developer, but I don’t feel
   like one. I don’t have a degree in computer science; I learned my way
   into this field (I’ll get to that), and I always feel like I need to
   give out that disclaimer when speaking to people about my skillset. Not
   only that, I don’t look the part at all. I’m not just saying I’m a
   female web developer; I’m saying I’m a high-heel-wearing, makeup-doing,
   cute-skirt-flaunting princess of a web developer. I wonder if people
   will take me seriously when they first look at me. Before I open my
   mouth. I figure they’ll think, “Oh, she means she’s a web designer.”
   Or, “She’s just the client-facing sales girl” (actually, that’s
   half-true with me nowadays, but really off topic right now).

   I tried asking my clients what they thought of me when they first met
   me, so I could do some qualitative research for this article, but my
   attempt failed when I realized this is a group of people who all chose
   to hire me. They all said the fact I was a girl had nothing to do with
   whether they thought I could handle the job. Does that make my
   above-described insecurity go away? No. And I think writers out there
   are pointing this out – that women are not brave enough to accept that
   their skillset is valuable to a company as much as a man’s in the
   technology field.

   Like for example, an article titled, [21]Where are the Women in
   WordPress? by Raelene Wilson, where she states, on behalf of only 12
   women who attended a WordPress gathering:

     Many women don’t think they’re smart enough and feel like outsiders
     despite the incredible work they do, and some women who work in
     development tell people they’re not a developer.

   Bang on. I couldn’t have described my own experience better.

   Then there’s this affirmation too: [22]a quote from Sheryl Sandberg,
   COO at Facebook:

     Women systematically underestimate their own abilities.

   But I have to acknowledge what got me inspired to write this article:
   it was when I heard Morten Rand-Hendriksen (a male) of Pink and Yellow
   give the [23]Keynote Speech at WordCamp Seattle 2013. It was an amazing
   speech, packed with lots of stats on how WordPress is changing the
   Internet. And here’s what he says about WordPress helping women in tech
   (it starts around 38:30 minutes into the video):

     WordPress is also chaining the Internet in one other very
     significant way. And as exemplified by [24]this graphic that was
     released by the good people who are running this event…There’s 60%
     men who registered (according to their first names)…the remaining
     40% are super heroes.

     The WordPress community consists of a very high number of women;
     very proportionately, a ridiculously high number of women. And not
     only that, but those women are essential parts of the development of
     WordPress, of the forward motion of WordPress and what’s happening
     with it.

     If you go to web development conferences you will generally find
     like two women, and they walk around with cages, because it’s like
     they’re magnets. If you go to design conferences, you get a larger
     proportion of women but there are very few women in development in
     general until you come to WordPress, and then all of a sudden you
     have all these women.

     The only thing that’s missing here is more women in front of the
     crowd. So I want all of you women here…to go back home after the
     conference, and think about what you’re going to present next year.
     Everyone in this room has something to present at WordCamp,
     something of value, something that other people will learn from, and
     especially the women, because we don’t get your point of view
     because you’re not presenting. So you need to step up and present,
     and that will happen.

   I did some research and it turns out this women in tech issue is a big
   one. Not only are women not studying computer sciences as much as they
   were in the 80s, they’re also feeling like [25]the industry treats them
   very poorly. Sexual harassment cases and [26]instances of sexism
   abound. Then there are companies ([27]like Mastercard) that try to
   promote ‘diversity’ by purposely hiring females, just to add some mix
   to the pile, because they see the lack of female voice in the industry.

Why WordPress Could Be Solving the “Women in Tech” Issue

1. WordPress is Easy and Designers Like That

   I’m not saying that women are stupid, but I am saying that WordPress is
   closing the gap between the non-techy and the techy, as was discovered
   in other parts of Morten’s speech noted above.

   Right now we know that more females will enter into design-related
   studies than they would computer science studies, and we can presume
   that design is easier than coding (sorry, although I dare not ever say
   it does not require education and brains to be a good designer). But
   the thing with design nowadays is that it requires a deep understanding
   of the Web.

   I hire designers (many of whom are female) and can see that if
   designers don’t start learning coding basics, they are going to become
   paralyzed as far as their involvement in the web industry is concerned.
   They may be comfortable in print, since that’s what design schools
   teach, but it’s time for them to step up their game and learn how
   technology works and ‘thinks,’ so that they’re not forcing technology
   to work with their designs, but rather allowing their designs to fit
   into technology.

   Thus we have the theming and design tracks at WordCamps, where amazing
   female speakers like [28]Suzette Franck (to name only one) talk about
   how to [29]make designs work with WordPress plus other [30]WordPress
   topics that take away the intimidation of technology for designers and
   the less technically-inclined.

   Plus, the proliferation of female-tailored themes on the WordPress
   theme marketplace today can testify to the fact that women want to make
   websites too, and WordPress is allowing them to do that very easily.

2. Theme Frameworks Are Making Developers Out of All Of Us

   I really like the philosophy of [31]Gary Jones, who I remember once
   saying something along the lines of “I code so you don’t have to.” The
   amazing thing about theme frameworks, like the Genesis framework that
   Gary contributes to, is that it makes it super easy for anyone (boy or
   girl) to make a fantastic-looking custom WordPress site with little
   knowledge of code, because someone else has taken care of the tricky
   parts already.

   So this is where I get to the story of how I, the princess web
   developer, learned to make websites:

   I started in journalism, and then later got my degree in Communication.
   It was during my Communication studies that I fell in love with
   marketing (and almost failed a computer science class — no joke). At my
   first job out of college I got trained in SEO and e-marketing. When I
   was later no longer working for a company, I realized I had to know
   about web development if I was going to continue selling myself in this
   field effectively. Since any smart Internet marketer nowadays is going
   to know the power of WordPress for making moolah online, I attempted to
   make my first web site with WordPress.

   I was dying to know how to change the logo in the top left corner of my
   beauty blog, and how to make the links pink instead of gray. So the
   late-night Google searches commenced as well as the many, many forum
   posts to the StudioPress community (sorry everyone, but your help got
   me to where I am today!). Soon my first clients approached me and,
   after I told them I’m a ‘nothing’ in this world, they said, “I trust
   you, and I want you to be the one to make my website.” And that was
   that. A few people saw strength where I saw weakness and it got me off
   the ground (I’m skipping a lot out of the story).

   I think my story is not unique, as a woman in tech, letting WordPress
   and a theme framework bring me into the field.

3. WordPress is Creating Business Owners and Women Are Good at Tech
Businesses

   Since you’re reading this, you may well be making a living developing
   WordPress websites as a self-employed business owner. If you’re not,
   just attend one of several WordCamps to see hundreds upon hundreds of
   self-employed web developers using WordPress. The fact that it’s easy,
   powerful and financially accessible is allowing developers to go out on
   their own as freelancers, without the backing of large, deep-pocketed
   agencies who monetize enterprise level content management systems (not
   that those don’t have their place). What WordPress can do used to cost
   thousands upon thousands. Now it’s free. That makes room for more
   competition.

   So here’s the thing. I’ll bet a lot of really techy guys (and girls)
   would look at me and think, “Why would anyone want to hire her? She
   doesn’t know half as much as I do about coding.” And I would agree with
   them. But I’m learning that the thing that makes me, a woman,
   successful in this industry is the fact that I’m able to sell myself.
   I’m friendly, approachable, organized, learned and I have a thorough
   explanation for why I do certain things and how I’m going to make that
   work for a business. Then I deliver. I’m not bragging, I’m just saying,
   it makes a difference when selling anything that you have a character
   (not just a personality) to go with it.

   Unfortunately – though I agree with [32]Chris it’s a stereotype with
   many points of falsehood – the web development industry is known for
   guys who dress like they’ve lost their will to live, who talk over your
   head with scary tech words, who say “Yes” to everything without
   delivering, who are never on time and make you feel stupid because you
   happen to not know as much about technology as they do. Add to that
   they know nothing about marketing or how their code is going to affect
   the way these websites will actually make money for a business later
   on.

   Ok, I know, not all tech guys are like that. I know many who are not.
   But I’m making a point. And…also saying what I’ve described above does
   exist.

   What can we conclude from this? Women can be the human key to bridging
   the gap between techy and non-techy, just like WordPress is a platform
   that is doing the same thing. And that’s pretty darn awesome for
   conducting business. These are not my words alone — check out [33]this
   infographic with stats on how women are helping tech businesses
   flourish. It states that, “Teams with at least one female member
   outperform male-only groups in collective intelligence tests.” And
   check out this: “Tech companies with more women in management have 34%
   ROI.” Finally, “Women are starting tech businesses at a rate of 1.5
   times the national average.” I’m telling you, somethin’s cookin’ in the
   pot.

Just One Last Thing…

   Now, most articles ([34]like this one) describing women in tech show
   women in high executive roles at tech companies. I don’t like those
   articles. Do you know why? Because those executive-level positions are
   managerial. They’re not describing a woman with un-manicured nails who
   sits at her computer coding all day just like one of the guys (I said
   I’m a princess but manicures just don’t mesh well with my job).

   Those women worked their way up, which is inspiring, but to truly
   understand the effect women are having, and can have, in the tech world
   today, we need more success stories of female coders, not just female
   women working at tech companies as the “[35]project manager, business
   analyst, other IT, quality assurance tester and technical recruiter.”
   It’s time we hear stories of women like [36]Lisa French, who who said,
   “with my background, I was interested but didn’t think I could do it.
   But I’m here to say that you can do it.” Or [37]stories like Helen’s,
   where we learn what it’s like to be the only female developer at a
   software company.

   Like Morten said, we also need more female presenters at WordCamps and
   we need more men to encourage women to step up, to give them
   confidence, and to say that they admire the work they produce, because
   it’s pretty darn good. Then maybe we women won’t all hold back with our
   insecurities about working in a male dominated scene, and more amazing
   things can happen with WordPress and the Internet.

       Joyce, it's so difficult to write posts like this one. Thank you
       for sharing your experiences. I didn't enter the tech industry
       through WordPress but it has given me opportunities to grow in ways
       other systems would not. I work with two proprietary systems for
       one part of my job and another is focused on WordPress site
       development. Of the three, WordPress is the most widely used and
       probably most transferable skill.

       I have to say I agree with Angelique. I think you're downplaying
       feminism when, in fact, it is the one thing that has enabled you to
       say you're not a feminist! No matter your skills, Joyce, you
       wouldn't have even been given the opportunity at higher education
       if it wasn't for feminism. If it wasn't for feminism, ALL of us in
       the sciences would never have been allowed in, due to education
       being a boys' club. To say that you can compete with the boys and
       still not be a feminist is grossly misleading because, at best, you
       would have been nothing more than a domestic servant or family
       tutor competing with a degreed developer. You may say that you
       don't want to get into your political beliefs but human society IS
       political and to think otherwise is naive.
       And yes, equal skills is well and good but, as someone who was in
       the IT industry for 20+ years, you are speaking through rose-tinted
       spectacles. It means nothing when you have the experience and the
       ability and are still not paid parity with your male counterparts.
       I was always paid about 75% of my male counterpart's wage, despite
       the fact that I was a gun project manager. We still have a long way
       to go.
       Which brings me to another point. Why belittle women like me? I
       have three degrees and began as a coder, albeit with C++, Databus,
       COBOL, LISP, Fortran, etc. rather than the HTML and CSS you're
       probably more used to (and which are a helluva lot easier to learn
       and code, as I'm learning to do now). I have even taught Pascal,
       COBOL and Fortran at college-level. As time went on, I was given
       more responsibility. I was a project manager then a program
       manager. How does that make me "less tech" than you? Is there some
       kind of inverted snobbery going on here, where women who decide not
       to take on managerial roles somehow have more tech cachet than
       managers? Or maybe you don't understand what it means to be a good
       project manager. You mention selling yourself and yet, when I have
       done such a thing in order to advance in a corporate minefield, you
       dismiss stories like mine and "don't like" it.
       "They're not describing a woman with un-manicured nails who sits at
       her computer coding all day just like one of the guys".
       Good grief. I've always prided myself on my manicured nails (a
       total irrelevancy, tbh) and can type at 160+ words a minute. While
       I haven't always coded with "the guys", I've stared down Marketing
       departments with unrealistic release schedules and beta trials,
       Sales departments with pie-in-the-sky application brochures. I have
       initiated structured code reviews, overseen Quality Assurance, set
       up Training, assembled BOMs. In fact, Joyce, I have done all the
       things that, quite frankly, have kept you cosy and oblivious in
       your little cubicle, typing away at your keyboard with your chipped
       nails and yet you have the audacity to tell me that you "don't
       like" my story? What a shame.

       Great article, Joyce!
       I had a good chuckle when you mentioned you were an "un-manicured
       princess". I am as well! I have yet to comprehend how women, in any
       profession that involves a lot of typing on a keyboard, can have
       manicured (namely, long) nails. It affects my productivity! My +100
       WPM easily becomes -60 WPM when I sport the ever so popular and
       long french-tip nails. So, long &amp; pretty nails aren't in the
       cards for me, but that doesn't stop me putting nail polish on my
       pitifully short nails.
       As a female developer, I can honestly say that I've never
       experienced losing a job due to my gender (though I'll never truly
       know). However, the all of my work has been as a contractor or
       freelancer, working remotely from my home office. So gender (among
       other things) can easily be a non-existent deciding factor as it
       cannot be "seen". As a remote contractor or freelancer it becomes
       less about your appearance and more about your qualifications and
       competence in completing the job at hand. Appearance, gender, race,
       etc. are deciding factors in typical jobs, and that's the sad
       truth. You are being interviewed by a human being with bias' and
       prejudices. It's not just about your skillset or education. When
       you go in for a job interview, it's typically because you have the
       skillset, and the other half is you selling yourself or namely,
       looking the part. Of course you still need to sell yourself as a
       contractor/freelancer working online, but the outside appearance
       becomes far less of a deciding factor, if at all. So I think that's
       actually a large part in why I haven't faced any issue with my
       gender in my field, whereas I feel like I probably would have
       experienced some had I been applying for jobs at actual offices
       since there is a stereotype of the typical "male" developer that
       many females don't fit in.
       Of course, I have still experienced the male dominated field. When
       I was a developer at my first job, I was one of 2 female developers
       in a pool of 30 developers. Since I was so young, this was the
       first time I realized I was working in a male dominated field. At
       the time (we're talking 10 years ago), there were far fewer females
       in development than there were males than there are today. And
       there are many reasons for why that's changed, but I entirely agree
       with your statement that WordPress is one of these reasons. Being
       that WordPress is such an inviting community and one that makes
       getting involved so easy, I can see more woman believing that
       development is a career option for them as it's less "scary" these
       days, especially for females with no experience at all in the
       field. Without WordPress, I don't know that woman would be growing
       in this field as many females do start out as designers or
       marketers and then dabble in WordPress, which can lead to learning
       how to become a real developer.
       In any event, I'm happy to see more and more females at WordCamps
       and other developer related conferences! And I'm happy to be a
       female in tech – I love it!

       This article was more infuriating than encouraging. The author
       writes off feminism, belittles design and other traditionally
       female-dominated jobs in the tech sector, and trots out the same
       myth that tech is a meritocracy and the people who get ahead are
       the ones who deserve it or work the hardest (see Straight White
       Male: The Lowest Difficulty Setting There Is for a useful metaphor:
       [59]http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-l
       owest-difficulty-setting-there-is/)
       I think the WordPress community is a truly outstanding and
       welcoming place to be a woman in tech, but this article does a
       shabby job at communicating that.

            Hello Angelique,
            Thanks for your comment. It's great that the Internet is a
            place to exchange ideas and the purpose of blogging of course
            is to get a response and different viewpoints. That's why we
            have comments enabled :)
            I don't think I belittled feminism at all. I just said I am
            not one. There is nothing more to be said about that, and it's
            not a wrong thing for me to say what I am or to chose for
            myself how I want to be labelled. But no sentences were
            written about feminism as an ideology or movement at all, let
            alone negative ones. You can also read my responses to other
            commenters below about this and why I said what I said.
            I also said clearly that I don't think it doesn't require
            education or brains to be a designer and that I hire
            designers. If I wanted to put down that role, I would have
            said something different. The fact that I hire designers and
            mentioned that in the article shows that I see their expertise
            as being very valuable to the work I do. If I thought
            designers were not valuable, I would try to do their job on my
            own. But I can't. They are irreplaceable in web development,
            especially the ones that are learning the intricacies of web.
            I owe my success to the great designers I've had the privilege
            of working with (among other roles needed in web marketing).
            The other traditionally female jobs were also not belittled at
            all. I made it clear that I myself came from that background
            and the point of the article was that WordPress allowed me to
            enter into technology in a deeper way than if it didn't exist.
            Also, the article says clearly that we need stories of women
            in tech who are not JUST in those other roles. I never said
            those roles are not useful. My point was that many articles of
            women in tech don't do justice to showcase the women who are
            actually coding. Running a tech business in a managerial
            position, or another role is not the same as being the hands
            that labour to produce the technology. That's the difference
            that was pointed out. In no way was there any belittling
            involved in what I said. Not at all.
            In short, I think you may have read too far into what I was
            saying, or mistook completely what I was trying to say.
            The hard thing about writing in this capacity is that you
            always have to chose what you're going to leave in an article
            and what you're going to leave out of the article. Both are
            important, and both are hard decisions to make. If you put
            everything in, people loose interest. I could have explained
            why I said every little thing I said, but at what point does
            the reader lose interest? The idea is to read articles in
            their entire context, and to gather the main point the author
            is trying to make, not to dissect the article, take one word
            out of the entire thing, and try to make out-of-context
            conclusions about what the author is or believes. None of the
            things you mentioned were my point or intention at all. Not
            even close. Sorry if I infuriated you or gave you the wrong
            impression with my words.

                 Hi, Joyce, and thanks for your reply.
                 You suggest in your comment to Emma that a shift is
                 happening in tech, but that it's not happening because of
                 the actions of women (e.g., "like the suffragettes").
                 Women aren't advancing in tech because of something in
                 the air; this isn't something that's just occurring
                 organically. Women in STEM fields are advancing because
                 of the work of the women who came before them and because
                 of the work of advocates and allies who promote the work
                 of women and take to task people who discriminate, attack
                 or belittle women.
                 I get that you only mentioned feminism once and feel like
                 some of our comments are derailing, but it's the second
                 sentence in a women-in-tech article. You gave it
                 importance and prominence. If you wrote the article
                 without any of that info and I showed up demanding to see
                 your feminist credentials, that would be a different
                 story. You're right that people bring different baggage
                 to this word, but, to my eyes, you essentially started an
                 article about the place of women in the WordPress
                 community with: "I don't believe in equality for women.
                 Far from it."
                 That's a pretty strong statement from someone who has
                 clearly benefitted from the work and struggle of
                 feminists and something you thought was important to
                 provide background/context to your writing. Given both of
                 these things, it's a bit odd to now ask people to dismiss
                 or look past this statement.
                 On the issue of belittling women's traditional roles in
                 the tech field…You imply that, on sight, people will
                 assume that you're a web designer and/or "the
                 client-facing sales girl." You imply that these
                 assumptions mean you're not being taken seriously. You
                 say that design is easier than coding. Honestly, bad
                 design is just as easy as bad coding. Good design, like
                 good, thoughtful code, is harder. If your definition of
                 design is something like "making things pretty" then
                 you're just underestimating what good design is and the
                 impact of a good designer. If you see being "just a web
                 designer" as a put down, how is that not belittling the
                 folks that do that job and do it marvelously?

       You make it sound like it's a bad thing to be a feminist! :) Maybe
       there are really negative stereotypes associated with the word, but
       you may unintentionally give them credence by suggesting it's bad
       to be a feminist. Everyone benefits when we just say who we are and
       what we are for, not what we aren't and how we are afraid of being
       misunderstood.
       I think you are right in your main points, but I would put it more
       like this: software like WP and "frameworks" like Genesis are
       accessible to a lot of people who don't really understand the
       underlying technology much or at all. This can be a problematic way
       to "get into tech", but it can get you in, and it does expand the
       market for "custom web development" in part by increasing supply
       and driving prices for it down.
       One additional point where I hope not to be misunderstood is that
       I'm not sure it is really being a "developer" as opposed to a "site
       builder" or "marketing specialist who builds websites" if other
       people code so you really *never* have to — and you couldn't if you
       did have to. I think it's important to acknowledge this, not to put
       anyone down, but to be honest and clear about where different
       people stand and what other rooms there are to explore.
       If things like WP start to get more women into software engineering
       in schools, that will be a big win, but if more just use accessible
       software to focus on the business, content and marketing side,
       that's a win too. And it's not like this doesn't go for guys too. I
       suspect a common trend is that a lot of us (men and women) with
       liberal arts, writing, journalism and communications backgrounds
       were the ones who got told we were "bad at math" (see what Jo
       Boaler at Stanford has to say about that) or just didn't get deep
       into things like programming for whatever reason, yet software has
       become ever more accessible to us as a tool for our crafts, like
       design and/or writing.

            Hi Dan! That's some great points to add to the article! I
            agree with all of it.
            I think the hard part about going around saying "I'm a web
            site builder" is that if the general, non-techy population
            comes to me and says, "so are you a developer can you make me
            a web site" and I say "no, that is not accurate, I am a web
            site builder" they'd be like "sooooo….isn't that what I just
            said?" I've thought of other ways of describing what I do, but
            in the end I feel like simplicity is best! There are so many
            better things to educate people on in the technology world.
            Not least of which are things like how to use a search bar
            properly and not type in a web URL into Google to get to a
            website :) So many people who use technology are so new to it,
            so if I try to clarify the usage of vocabulary to those
            people, well, then I'm just in the same boat as the people who
            isolate their clients and make them feel stupid :) So the term
            "web developer" it is! But between you and I, you can call me
            a "web site builder", I'd be just dandy happy with that :)
            I don't think that I made it sound bad to be a feminist. I
            described my stance in detail to Emma which you can also read.
            You are right that "everyone benefits when we just say who we
            are and what we are for, not what we aren't and how we are
            afraid of being misunderstood." I purposely did not want to be
            misunderstood for being a feminist, so I did exactly what you
            thought I should do – which is to be honest about what I am
            and what I am not. I'm allowed personal beliefs :) But I never
            said anything bad about feminism. I only told my story to show
            that this is an issue that does not JUST surround the cause of
            feminism. It's an issue that is about making things better –
            like better websites, better Internet, better businesses, and
            so on. Anyway, the reply to Emma explains this in more detail.
            But I wish this thread of comments would not go in this
            direction – a moral debate on feminism or its definition is
            not the goal of this post! That word was used ONCE in the
            whole 4900-word article. There is so much more to be said
            about this topic than one person's preferential way of
            identifying herself, especially more positive things! You
            brought out many of them, thank you for that :)

       Why would you say you aren't a feminist? I feel that you make your
       points weaker by trying to qualify your arguments like that. So,
       you're not a feminist? Do you not believe in equal treatment, equal
       opportunity and equal pay? If you are "far from" a feminist as you
       described, then it implies that you do not believe in these things.
       Or do you just think that the whole "raging feminist" image clashes
       with your self-described image as a high-heel-wearing professional?
       Do you fear that your colleagues and readers would take you less
       seriously if you took an incredibly benign political stance by
       professing your belief in equal pay and treatment? Sexism exists in
       tech, and I find it laughable when women who have received this
       treatment go out of their way to say they aren't feminists, or that
       they don't think women should receive special treatment. We need
       more feminists in tech. We need more male feminists who foster a
       creative and supportive work environment for their female
       colleagues. We need more diversity in tech.

            Hello Emma, thanks for your comment.
            I think a few people might have read between the lines a
            little too far regarding the fact I'm not a feminist.
            The reason I said I'm not a feminist is because I'm not a
            feminist. It is really quite simple. I don't want to get into
            my political ideological beliefs here, they are not relevant
            and this is not the blog for them :)
            But I guess if we pursued this further we'd get into a debate
            about the definition of what a "feminist" is, which I think
            would veer us off topic from the point I was trying to make in
            the article (maybe you could blog about it though!)
            The reason I wanted to mention that I'm not a feminist is
            because I wanted to show that this is an article not meant to
            be written from that view point (on purpose). The article is
            an observation of the way WordPress could be changing the
            cultural landscape of what we traditionally associate with
            technology, in more ways than one. If you watch Morten's
            keynote speech you will see that. It is quite amazing. And so,
            I believe (and I'm entitled to my beliefs, please respect
            that), it's not about women's rights, because it's not like
            women don't have the 'right' to study or be in tech in. It's
            that they're not (probably for the reasons described in the
            article). But with WordPress, they are finding it easier. And
            that, in effect is having a positive impact on the Internet as
            a whole. It can make the Internet a better place and it can
            make businesses more successful. Have you noticed on another
            scale, how non-competitive the WordPress community is? I find
            it fascinating the developers who are technically business
            competitors all are willing to help each other. You don't see
            that a lot in other industries. The ideology and culture
            around WordPress is quite different than the rest of the way
            people use and behave on the Internet.
            So I said I'm not a feminist because I purposely did not want
            to write from the viewpoint of "this is just wrong and we have
            to fix it." But rather from the view point of, "look, even I'm
            not a feminist fighting for women's rights and trying to be as
            equal as a male (if you want to define feminism that way), but
            see how WordPress has changed my life as a female in tech."
            There is an ideological shift happening, and it's not
            necessarily because of a fight that women historically had to
            put up (like the suffragettes). It's just happening, and I
            stated the reasons why I think it's happening. That's the main
            thing that was meant to come across.
            That being said, if you want to label yourself as a feminist,
            that's ok :) But there's no need to fight me for the way I
            chose to identify myself :) The great thing about being me is
            that I get to chose what to call myself. Let's change the
            Internet into a positive place, please, and avoid hostile
            comments, which don't really advance humanity or the knowledge
            and sharing of mutually respected ideas. Share ideas, tell us
            your stories, but without attacking individuals.

       Excellent article Joyce… thanks.
       I'm a "Women in Tech" and I've been working as a freelance
       WordPress designer and developer for a few years now. For over 20
       years I've worked in IT – hardware and software – end user support
       and server management. Many years ago I completed an MCSE and I was
       the only woman in sight.
       I also enjoy the 'softer' side of computing, such as graphic
       design, gaming and 'mucking about' with software. I used to love
       trying to get games to work back in the days of DOS, Windows 3.1
       and 95 – and then I would quickly get bored of the game itself.
       Making the game run was the challenge.
       Running a web design business suits me very well, as it involves
       plenty of graphical work, as well getting stuck into the more
       technical background stuff that I find challenging, such as HTML,
       CSS, PHP, MySQL, VPS Hosting, etc.
       I've enjoyed, and am still enjoying, a great career in IT even
       though I also harbour insecurities about working in a male
       dominated scene. And one note to any girls out there who are just
       starting out: I met lots of nice, smart guys in the MCSE courses,
       and none in the Word courses… just a thought :-)
