       Libby McMillan
       Libby McMillan's friends know not to invite her to anything on a
       Saturday in fall.  She was raised in a football-crazy household and
       now finds herself living in the heart of SEC country while still
       rooting for one particular Big 12 team.  McMillan's not totally
       conference-driven, however, as she also follows teams in the Pac
       12, Big 10, Mountain West and ACC conferences.  Her dream lunch
       companion: Coach Mike Leach, now at Washington State.
