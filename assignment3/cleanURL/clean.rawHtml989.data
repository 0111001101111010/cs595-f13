16 Sep 2013: Canadian Scientists Fight Back
Against Government Censorship Rules

   Stephen Harper
   World Econ. Forum
   Prime Minister Stephen Harper
   Recent rules silencing government researchers in Canada have sparked
   protests in 16 major cities, [3]the Guardian reports. The Harper
   administration over the past few years has ordered scientists at
   Canada's National Research Council, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and
   other government research agencies not to discuss work on a number of
   climate- and environment-related issues with journalists, the public,
   or even fellow researchers. Scientists have been asked not to comment
   on topics ranging from snowflakes to salmon, even after results have
   been published in major scientific journals. "It isn't the way science
   is supposed to be," John Stone, a retired Environment Canada scientist
   now working as a vice-chair of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change, told the Guardian. "It's not the way science used to be, the
   way I remember it in the federal government." Critics charge that the
   Harper administration has a [4]track record of muzzling environmental
   research. Earlier this month it was also accused of stalling a major
   report on greenhouse emissions — widely expected to document
   significant rises in carbon pollution — because the study could deal a
   blow to Harper's efforts to secure U.S. approval of the Keystone XL
   pipeline, the Guardian reports.
