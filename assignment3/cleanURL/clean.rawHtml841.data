Art Instruction in a Comfortable Setting
       My son has been a student of Linda Wehrli almost five years. As a
       child who only wanted to draw, she patiently introduced him to
       different mediums -- pastels, watercolors, acrylics and oils. Linda
       has a keen sense of the passions of her students, and uses that to
       encourage them in their creativity. She provides individual
       instruction, so each child is working as his/her own level and
       pace. The studio is located at the back of a home, which provides a
       relaxed, tranquil setting. Linda maintains a library of books from
       which students may choose their subjects, and supplies may be
       conveniently purchased on site. I would recommend this studio to
       anyone looking for a creative place to escape!

Great for children and adults
       My child has been studying art with Linda Wehrli for over two
       years. The
       instruction is excellent. With her experience and expertise, Linda
       Wehrli is
       able to work with each student in a very individualized nurturing
       and
       positive atmosphere that allows each student to explore their
       vision without
       imposed barriers or self conscious editing. Linda's approach for
       the
       beginning student includes a strong foundation beginning with the
       study of
       color and creation of a color palate, hand strengthening exercises
       and
       beginning perspective practice. The lessons include a study and
       drawing of
       a broad range of objects. My child's visual expressions have
       blossomed as a
       result of her art class experiences, she runs into class each week.
       I highly
       recommend this art school for both children and adults.

Linda Wehrle
       My daughter, who has been playing for 8 eight years, has been with
       Linda for two years. Linda is by far the best teacher we have had.
       She keeps kids interested and working regardless of their level.
       She is responsive to their needs and flexible with the scheduling
       if anything comes up-like ortho appointments, etc. Her recitals are
       great and well organized, and always fun.
       5 stars, no doubt about it.

Excellent piano instruction
       My daughters have been studying piano with Linda Wehrli for just a
       few months, and we have been thorougly impressed with the quality
       of instruction and with Linda herself. This is not a "learn to play
       a song today!" kind of program. Instead Linda focuses on the
       foundation of a musical education - reading music, ear training,
       and music theory - along with piano. The lessons are well-paced,
       and Linda is warm, positive, and encouraging. I have never had to
       remind my daughters to practice, as they're always eager to get to
       the next section, or the next book, and to show off how much
       they've learned. The studio is pleasant and easy to find (once you
       know what you're looking for). Street parking only, but it's not
       usually a problem. Definitely recommended.
