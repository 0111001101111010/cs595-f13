   Learn C# Programming (in ten easy steps) is suitable for
   beginner programmers. Step-by-step it explains how to write C# code to
   develop Windows or Mac applications using either the free Visual C#
   Express, a commercial edition of Microsoft Visual Studio or the free
   MonoDevelop for OS X.

   C# is one of the most widely used an important of all modern
   programming languages. If you need to learn C# quickly and painlessly,
   this is the perfect course.

   You will begin by learning the core features of programming –
   variables, constants, functions and data types. You will move on
   rapidly to learn about Object Orientation and the more advanced
   features of C# and the .NET framework such as file-handling,
   data-streaming, dealing with exceptions (errors) and overriding
   methods. Even if you start out as a complete beginner, by the end of
   this course you will have built a really solid foundation of
   programming knowledge and skills.

   The sample projects are all provided ready for you to download, run and
   modify. The course also includes a course eBook that provides even more
   information on the topics being discussed.

   The course instructor, Huw Collingbourne, is Director of Technology
   with SapphireSteel Software, a company that specialises in Visual
   Studio development tools (written in C#) for professional programmers.

   Learn C# Programming (in ten easy steps) is the fastest and simplest
   way to help you make the move from coding novice to professional
   programmer.
