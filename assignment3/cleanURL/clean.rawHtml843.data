Social Media: An extension of Your College Applications

   social media resized 600 You are linked in, connected and wired, but
   are you really safe from prying eyes?  In the world of college
   admissions, this is something you should think about rather seriously.
   Each year there are more and more stories of colleges searching for
   applicants on the Internet, just to see what they can find.  If they
   are on the fence between two applicants, and they find some social
   media--like a picture or a tweet--of one of the applicants flipping off
   the camera or smiling and holding a can of spray paint, they'll
   probably go with the other applicant.  Who wouldn't?  In this day and
   age of privacy settings and ever-better technology, how can you really
   know what people can and cannot find about you?  Google yourself
   sometime, and see what comes up, but in the meantime, here are some
   great principles that you can apply to your daily life to keep yourself
   safe.

    1. Colleges are not your friends, so they won't get your jokes

   Be careful with thinking that just because it was so funny when it
   happened, everyone will get it.  Inside jokes are only funny to the
   people who were there, and pictures (like your Halloween costume on
   Instagram) are very open to bad interpretations.  When people don't
   know you, they have to try to make an impression of you, and "you only
   get once chance to make a first impression", so make it a great one.

    2.  Be cyber professional

   Think about your professional image.  I know it may seem early, but
   real life starts now.  Will colleges take you seriously if your email
   address is sexybeachbabe22@gmail.com?  Would an employer want to hire
   you if your Twitter handle was @PartyOnDude?  Try to think beyond
   making your friends laugh, and always think about how something will
   look in two months or two years.  I recommend a straight-up, boring
   email address--like your name.  That's never wrong (unless your parents
   have a bad sense of humor).  Jokes are best kept between you and your
   friends.  Just as you select your clothes each day as a reflection of
   your personal style, every time you post on social media, you are
   selecting parts of your professional image. You want to go far in life,
   right?  Well then, keep it classy!

    3.  If you wouldn't want your grandma to see it, don't post it

   The Grandma Test is always a winner, and you can use this to help you
   out in a lot of situations, forever.  If you wouldn't show it to her,
   then don't post it.  If you wouldn't want her to see you doing it, then
   skip it.  If you wouldn't repeat it to her, don't say it or tweet it.
   Proper is always in style, your Grandma will be proud, and I guarantee
   you, the other kids will look up to you.  Everyone loves a role model.

    4.  Watch your profile pictures

   These are often searchable, and your Facebook wallpaper comes up no
   matter how strict your privacy settings are. Make sure the images you
   choose are images you wouldn't mind a college admissions officer
   seeing.  And to help you out, always imagine it's your dream school
   that stumbles upon the pic. (Just because you un-tag yourself, that
   picture is still out there, online...)  I'm not suggesting you post
   photos of yourself knitting and using your library card, but do think
   first, young Skywalker.

    5.  You are the company you keep online

   Who do you like?  Who do you follow?  What hobbies are you into?  What
   do you read?  What do you hashtag? #Thinkaboutit. How would all of your
   interests look to a college, to a potential employer, or to the father
   of a girl you'd like to ask out?  Think from somebody else's
   perspective.  My great Grandma always said, "Birds of a feather flock
   together", so choose your flock with care because you become like them.
   Even your fave foods and bands become a part of your online image.

    It's a high tech world these days, kids, and college admissions has
   joined the party, literally.  Your professional image is an extension
   of your college application, and while you might want to stay a
   blissfully innocent child for a little longer, the truth is, your
   professional image is real, and it starts now.  As you get ready to
   apply to college, think about your social media presence, make wise
   choices, and in all things, protect your dreams!
