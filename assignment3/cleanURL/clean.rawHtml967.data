[7]Baylor study: 10-inch whale earwax — yes, ewww — reveals a lifetime of
pollution exposure

   Posted by The Baylor Proud Team in [8]Academics, [9]Research

   Drs. Stephen Trumble and Sascha Usenko

   A chance conversation between two Baylor professors while walking
   across campus has led to [10]new insights on how pollutants and other
   man-made stressors impact marine animals.

   While strolling across the Baylor campus to get coffee, [11]Dr. Stephen
   Trumble, an assistant professor of biology, was describing to his
   colleague how biologists use the layers in a whale’s earwax to age a
   whale (similar to how tree rings reveal age). [12]Dr. Sascha Usenko, an
   assistant professor of environmental science, had been using sediment
   cores to study pollution in U.S. national parks. His ears perked up;
   could the whale earplugs provide similar data for the oceans?

   Over the past two years, Trumble and Usenko have sought to answer that
   question. Their finding: A very resounding “yes.” The plugs of earwax —
   built up over a whale’s entire life — allowed the scientists to, for
   the first time, reconstruct the contaminants encountered by the animal.
   Specifically, the pair found mercury as well as organic contaminants
   such as pesticides and flame retardants in the first sample they
   studied, demonstrating that both man-made and endogenous chemicals are
   recorded and archived in whale earwax.

   [[13]WATCH video of how Trumble and Usenko study the earwax.]

   Last week, the Baylor pair’s research findings were published in the
   [14]Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United
   States of America. Since then, the results have been picked up by
   dozens of news outlets: [15]Nature, [16]National Geographic,
   [17]Smithsonian, [18]Wired, [19]NPR, [20]NBC, [21]MSN, [22]Yahoo!, and
   newspapers from [23]Los Angeles to [24]Atlanta.

   My favorite? [25]This German Public Radio interview with Trumble.
   (Seriously – give it a listen.)

   Sic ’em, Baylor researchers!
