Getting Started

   An introduction to Semantic coding

   Interfacing Carefully Semantic APIs

Interfacing Carefully

   UI definitions in Semantic are given the class name ui. This is to help
   tell the difference between ui elements and parts of the definition of
   an element. For example a menu may have menu items inside of it. These
   items are contained as part of the menu definition but do not receive
   the class name ui.

   Class names in semantic always use single english words. If a class
   name is an adjective it is either a [52]type of element or
   [53]variation of an element. CSS definitions always define adjectives
   in the context of a noun. In this way class names cannot pollute the
   namespace.

Combining elements

   All UI definitions in semantic are stand-alone, and do not require
   other components to function. However, components can choose to have
   optional couplings with other components.

   For example you might want to include a badge inside a menu. A label
   inside of a menu will automatically function as a badge.

Semantic APIs

   Modules define a public API using verbs and simple phrases. When
   methods are invoked internally those phrases are matched to internal
   methods automatically.

Opening a new tab with a behavior

   Modules have simple behaviors for triggering common actions
   $('.demo.menu .item') .tab('change tab', 'second') ;

Opening a new tab with multiple behaviors

   Any internal behavior is accessible as well
   $('.demo.menu .item') .tab('deactivate all') .tab('activate tab',
   'third') .tab('activate navigation', 'third') ;

Turning on HTML5 State

   Modules can be re-initialized at any time with different settings
   $('.demo.menu .item') .tab({ history : true, path :
   '/introduction/getting-started.html' }) ;
