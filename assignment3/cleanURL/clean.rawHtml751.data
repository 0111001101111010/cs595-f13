   The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that by 2020, there will be 1.4
   million jobs in computer science. But American universities are on
   track to produce qualified graduates to fill less than a third of those
   jobs, and only a tiny number of the graduates we do produce are women.
   According to U.S. Department of Commerce, just one out of every seven
   engineers are in this country are women.

   [37]Girls Who Code wants to change that. The organization just
   concluded its second summer of computer science immersion camps for
   high school girls. This year, the nonprofit went national, expanding
   from one camp in New York to programs in Detroit, San Francisco, and
   San Jose. Campers have built apps to help the disabled navigate New
   York's subways, Twitter-based apps for book clubs, and complex video
   games; alumnae have returned to their schools to start pilot Girls Who
   Code Clubs and lobby for more computer science courses, since many high
   schools don’t offer them. (To meet the overwhelming demand and reach
   more girls with their programs, especially in under-served communities,
   the organization will be launching a new Girls Who Code Clubs effort
   this fall.)

   In Detroit, Girls Who Code hosted 20 girls for eight weeks in
   partnership with GE and the Knight Foundation, working with 50-plus
   mentors and leaders at GE’s Advanced Manufacturing and Software
   Technology Center. Most of the mentors were women. "If you look at who
   the girls are exposed to—half of our most senior IT leaders are
   women—they were literally seeing themselves there," says Kim Bankston,
   who led the program for GE. "The mentors the girls had were women with
   10 to 20 years of experience in IT. They could tell their story of
   growing up in Michigan and going into this field."

   We need more talent, and the girls of this generation need to be a part
   of it.

   Bankston is frank: we need more talent, and the girls of this
   generation need to be a part of it. Showing them that information
   technology is a cool field—and one not to fear—is key, especially since
   technology figures significantly into just about every industry.

   In Detroit, the campers went to the office every day, working on
   laptops and practicing basic coding lessons. They also spent time in
   GE’s aviation center, research facilities, and robot garage, to learn
   about automation and app design, and took field trips to Google, GM,
   and the Henry Ford Museum.

   Their final projects spotlight the innovative ways in which the girls
   learned to break down and solve problems using technology: one group
   created an app called Sisters Understanding Math and Science (SUMS),
   which included inspiring quotes, examples of female leaders, and games.
   Another created a website called Define Green , that allowed users to
   calculate their carbon footprints and included strategies for reducing
   them.

   Audrey Smith, a 16-year-old student from Roseville, Michigan,
   co-designed a website called Find Your College, which helps high school
   students with the college application process. "I’d been thinking about
   colleges—I didn’t know the ones that would be the best ones for me, and
   I knew that other people would definitely be having the same problem,"
   she says. Through the project, which tells users about different types
   of schools (liberal arts colleges vs. technical schools, for example)
   and the breakdown of what each has to offer (male/female student ratio,
   top majors), she zeroed in on her own preferences.

   "Something I want in a college is to feel at home—where it’s smaller,
   where computer science is important, and where people have those same
   interests," she says. During the summer, the thrill of having a peer
   group (girls she now describes as "sisters") excited about coding and
   computers, she says, opened up her world. The skills she picked up have
   already proved useful; she’s about to design a jobs-related website for
   her father.

   Audrey’s favorite field trip was the one to GM. "I could picture myself
   working there," she says. "They told us about working with the cars,
   the coding behind it. Basically, cars—they’re computers. There’s so
   much coding behind it. Most people wouldn’t think that."

   The opening of all these doors, she said, was life-changing: "I loved
   the feeling of the future."
