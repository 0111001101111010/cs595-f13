4 College Savings Tips for Community College Students

It may be better to pay for community college outright if you’re planning to
finish a four-year degree.

   Paying cash for community college tuition and skipping dorm life can
   reduce costs and allow 529 plan investments to continue to grow.

   Paying cash for community college tuition and skipping dorm life can
   reduce costs and allow 529 plan investments to continue to grow.

   Many students start off at a community college to save some cash before
   going off to a [53]four-year university to complete a bachelor's
   degree. But families won't save as much money off the total cost of a
   four-year degree if they don't manage the [54]community college years
   carefully.

   Course choice, scholarship and financial aid applications, student
   budgets and [55]529 plan distributions – the money from a
   tax-advantaged college investment account – should all be part of
   planning how to pay for a community college student's education.

   Experts recommend families and students do the following to maximize
   college savings.

   [Find out [56]what you can buy with 529 plan distributions.]

   1. Check transfer credits before enrolling each semester: A big way
   [57]students can save money when starting out at community college is
   by letting the school know where they plan on finishing their education
   before they even choose courses.

   Don't take two years of course work and find out nothing transfers,
   says Scott Sprinkle, a Colorado-based certified public accountant.

   Not doing enough research could mean families would to have to pay for
   an extra year or two of tuition at a four-year school. If a family had
   saved for only two years of a four-year university education, they
   would now have to find a new way to pay for the extra time in school.

   At some colleges, the admissions office is the place to get help
   planning future college transfers, says Paul Seegert, admissions
   director at the [58]University of Washington. At other schools,
   students need to contact individual academic departments, he says.

   Make sure the community college you choose has transfer agreements with
   four-year institutions, especially anywhere students are considering
   completing their education. The University of Washington has
   arrangements with 36 community and technical colleges in the state to
   accept specific transfer courses, Seegert says.

   2. Avoid exceeding financial aid time limits: According to federal
   financial aid rules, you can't exceed maximum time limits for receiving
   aid and course work must count toward your degree. Students should
   "take care of as many of the basic requirements as they can at the
   community college," says Kay Lewis, director of financial aid at the
   University of Washington.

   This is another reason why students should verify that their courses
   will count toward a final degree. Taking courses that don't count
   toward graduation from a four-year school could extend a student's time
   in school past maximum federal and state financial aid time limits.

   For instance, the maximum time limit for [60]Pell Grant eligibility is
   12 semesters. Families that normally would qualify for the federal
   student aid program may have planned on having these funds when
   determining how much to save. If they exceed the 12-semester limit,
   they can't count on these funds for the latter years of schooling.

   "Many state grant programs have eligibility limits for time to degree,
   too," Lewis says. Students should check with their state department of
   education to verify state eligibility limits.

   3. Pay cash, but don't skimp on scholarship applications: When
   possible, pay cash for community college, so money that is invested in
   a 529 plan can continue to grow to help pay for the last two years of
   college, says Sprinkle.
