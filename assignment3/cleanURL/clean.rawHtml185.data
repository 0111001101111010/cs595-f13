Startups cleaning up Microsoft Exchange, Gmail and JavaScript

Webinno event in Cambridge introduces Skimbox, Qbaka and more newcomers

   Finding an enterprise IT company at a startup gathering these days can
   be like searching for an obscure email in a crowded inbox.

   But in prepping to attend Tuesday night's  [166]Web Innovators Group
   (Webinno) event  in Cambridge, Mass., I did find one, and maybe two
   enterprise-focused newcomers:  [167]Skimboxand  [168]Qbaka.

   Skimbox, of the two, is most clearly enterprise-focused, not that it
   doesn't also cater to consumers in this blurry world where personal and
   work lives intermingle. The Skimbox product (formerly known as Gander)
   is an AI-powered client that's designed to help users get to the emails
   they really need to see in a "Mainbox", and sort the rest for later
   viewing if necessary in a "Skimbox". The app, which requires the end
   user to mainly tap and swipe, employs information such as past
   relationships with a sender and keywords to sort messages into one box
   or the other.

   Network World - Finding an enterprise IT company at a startup gathering
   these days can be like searching for an obscure email in a crowded
   inbox.

   But in prepping to attend Tuesday night's [172]Web Innovators Group
   (Webinno) event in Cambridge, Mass., I did find one, and maybe two
   enterprise-focused newcomers: [173]Skimboxand [174]Qbaka.

   Skimbox, of the two, is most clearly enterprise-focused, not that it
   doesn't also cater to consumers in this blurry world where personal and
   work lives intermingle. The Skimbox product (formerly known as Gander)
   is an AI-powered client that's designed to help users get to the emails
   they really need to see in a "Mainbox", and sort the rest for later
   viewing if necessary in a "Skimbox". The app, which requires the end
   user to mainly tap and swipe, employs information such as past
   relationships with a sender and keywords to sort messages into one box
   or the other.

   A free version of the app is available from the start for iOS devices
   and works to clean up your Gmail account.

   (I started downloading it on my iPhone while writing this post...and
   it's still plowing through my messages as I finish this. I'll blame iOS
   7 for that. Though I am curious to see if it's all that much more
   effective than the new Gmail, which does a pretty good job of sifting
   through and sorting primary, social and promotional emails for me
   already.)

   A Microsoft Exchange version, which is where the enterprise IT angle
   comes in, is in the works for mid-October and you can [175]sign up if
   you want to be notified when it gets approved for the App Store. CEO
   David Wihl told me at Webinno that Skimbox will charge per user per
   month for this version of the product, which can be run in the cloud
   or, for very security conscious customers, on premises as a virtual
   appliance. Wihl says: "the more you use [Skimbox], the better it gets."

   (We're guessing a Windows Phone version of the app might not be right
   around the corner despite the fact that Watertown, Mass.-based Skimbox
   spun out of SoftArtisans, a company heavily into Microsoft Office
   software.)



   Startup Qbaka is less obviously an enterprise IT firm, but it offers a
   cloud-based service that helps companies' developers spot problems and
   fix website front-ends and mobile HTML5 apps.

   The offering, which involves inserting a small block of script into
   your web services, can be used to analyze the cause of JavaScript
   errors, such as software bugs, problems interacting with different
   browsers, etc.

   The service is free for tracking up to 200 errors per day and at least
   initially costs $20 per month for unlimited tracking. (Here's a
   [176]link to a video explaining the offering further.)

   The other companies showing off their wares at Webinno are interesting,
   just not enterprise focused. Among them, [177]WriterAccess, which seeks
   to match up writers with companies looking for ways to more efficiently
   push their messages, and [178]TicketZen, an iPhone/Android app for
   streamlining payment of parking tickets (Though does it help you get
   out of your parking tickets? I recently had one rescinded after sending
   in photographic evidence of the shakiness of the charge.)
