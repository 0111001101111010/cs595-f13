LexisNexis acknowledges hacking

   LexisNexis

   By [128]Thomas Gnau

   Staff Writer

   Two LexisNexis servers were compromised by hackers this year, the
   company acknowledged Wednesday.

   Hackers used a software tool to retrieve personal data aggregated by
   three companies, including LexisNexis, a blogger wrote.

   A cybersecurity blog said two servers within LexisNexis networks were
   attacked. Based in New York City, LexisNexis employs some 3,400 workers
   at a Miami Twp. campus, its largest concentration of employees in North
   America.

   “LexisNexis confirmed that the two systems listed in the botnet
   interface were public-facing LexisNexis Web servers that had been
   compromised,” wrote Brian Krebs, a blogger who describes himself as a
   former Washington Post reporter with an interest in computer security.

   Krebs wrote that “a tiny unauthorized program called ‘nbc.exe’ was
   placed on (LexisNexis) servers as far back as April 10, 2013,
   suggesting the intruders have had access to the company’s internal
   networks for at least the past five months.”

   A number of web sites picked up on the story Wednesday. InfoWorld.com
   described the attack by what it called “a Russian hacker gang which
   runs an identity theft service.”

   Krebs said the hackers’ program was designed to open an “encrypted
   channel of communications from within LexisNexis’s internal systems” to
   a botnet controller.

   A “botnet” is a network of computers infected with harmful software or
   “malware” and controlled by hackers.

   This summer, the “identity theft services” website, ssndob.ms, was
   attacked by multiple hackers, Krebs said. He called the episode an
   instance of “hacker-on-hacker activity.”

   Krebs wrote that he traced the sources of the stolen information to a
   “small but very potent” botnet. The botnet was tiny, fewer than a dozen
   computers in “strategically placed” locations, he said.

   “I would certainly describe them as sophisticated,” Krebs said in an
   interview.

   In a statement, LexisNexis said, “We contacted the FBI and initiated a
   comprehensive investigation working with a leading third party forensic
   investigation firm. In that investigation, we have identified an
   intrusion targeting our data but to date have found no evidence that
   customer or consumer data were reached or retrieved.”

   A spokesman for LexisNexis declined to say when the intrusion was
   discovered or whether the company could assure clients that personal
   data was not stolen.

   Mark Rasch, owner of Bethesda, Md.-based cybersecurity firm Rasch
   Technology & Cyberlaw, said big data aggregators are constantly under
   attack, and there are many different kinds of attacks.

   What sets this intrusion apart is that hackers were able to infiltrate
   an internal LexisNexis network and install at least one file within
   that network, Rasch said.

   Also, the hackers used botnets to collect data from multiple data
   aggregators, he said. And they were targeting data that is intended to
   be used for identity theft and fraud.

   Rasch called “disingenuous” LexisNexis’ statement that it has “no
   evidence” that personal data was compromised.

   “The question for LexisNexis is, can you assure the public that no
   personal information was taken?” Rasch said.

   Two other compromised systems belonged to the networks of Dun &
   Bradstreet and a company that performs employment background checks,
   Kroll Background America Inc., Krebs wrote.

   He quoted a Reed Elsevier vice president as saying that LexisNexis
   contacted the FBI when the company became aware of the intrusion.
   London-based Reed Elsevier owns LexisNexis.

   “They have a tremendous amount of information in their network, and I
   think for companies like that it’s safe to assume that they’re always
   under attack,” Krebs said of LexisNexis and Reed Elsevier.

   Of the three companies that were hacked, he felt LexisNexis took the
   intrusion most seriously. LexisNexis was the only company which spoke
   with him on the record about “what they found,” he said.

   “The other guys said, ‘Thank you for the information,’” Krebs said.

   This is not the first time LexisNexis has been hacked. In 2005, the
   company acknowledged that identity thieves misused passwords to tap the
   personal records of more than 300,000 Americans, fraudulently acquiring
   data from company databases, according to national reports.
