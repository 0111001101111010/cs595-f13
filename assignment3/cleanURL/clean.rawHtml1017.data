   Nanocomputers The first computer made entirely of microscopic carbon
   nanotubes has been built, say US scientists.

   The computer, built at [73]Stanford University's School of Engineering,
   and reported today in the journal [74]Nature, has been hailed as a big
   step in the quest for faster, ever-smaller electronic devices.

   While performing only basic functions at speeds likened to a 1950s
   computer, the tiny machine was hailed as a breakthrough in the search
   for an alternative to silicon transistors, which control the
   electricity flow in computer microchips.

   Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are rolled-up, single-layer sheets of carbon
   atoms -- tens of thousands can fit into the width of a single human
   hair.

   They are pliable and have the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any
   known material.

   Silicon is a good semiconductor but cannot be reduced to such a thin
   layer.

   Scientists believe the structure of CNTs may make them better at
   carrying currents -- thus yielding transistors that are faster, more
   energy efficient and smaller than silicon -- but actually building
   nanotube chips has proved difficult.

   "People have been talking about a new era of carbon nanotube
   electronics moving beyond silicon," says Stanford engineering Professor
   Subhasish Mitra, who led the research.

   "But there have been few demonstrations of complete digital systems
   using this exciting technology. Here is the proof."

Tiny computer

   The computer is just a few square millimetres in size and able to
   perform basic counting and number-sorting functions using 178
   transistors each holding between 10 and 200 nanotubes.

   It runs at 1 kilohertz -- a processing capacity millions of times
   weaker than today's computers.

   The researchers say the 178-transistor limit was due to the engineering
   team using a university chip-making facility rather than an industrial
   process, meaning the computer could in theory be made much bigger and
   faster.

   The machine ran a basic operating system that allowed it to multitask
   and swap between the two processes, they add.

   Mitra and team say they have been able to deal with two inherent
   shortcomings of CNT transistors: the tubes do not always grow in
   perfectly straight lines, which means that mispositioned ones can cause
   a short circuit, while others change form and cannot be switched on and
   off.

   The team devised a method to burn up and eliminate the uncontrolled
   CNTs in a transistor and to bypass mispositioned ones.

Promise for the future

   Though it could take years, the Stanford approach hints at the
   possibility of industrial-scale production of CNT semiconductors,
   Naresh Shanbhag, director of a computer chip design consortium, said in
   a statement issued by the university.

   "These are initial necessary steps in taking carbon nanotubes from the
   chemistry lab to a real environment," added Supratik Guha, director of
   physical sciences for software giant IBM's Thomas J Watson Research
   Centre.

   Commenting on the achievement in Nature, Franz Kreupl of the Technische
   Universitaet Muenchen's Department of Hybrid Electronic Systems said
   the computer represented a significant advance in electronic
   engineering.

   But the transistors will have to become smaller than the current 8
   micrometres thick for the technique to be feasible, and the processor
   quicker, he said.
