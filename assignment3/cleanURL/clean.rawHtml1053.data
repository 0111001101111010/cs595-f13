   Reconnaissance is a term used in computer security. When you perform
   reconnaissance, you are looking for vulnerabilities, loopholes or weak
   spots that you can use to break into a computer, application or
   network. Hackers are always scanning for vulnerabilities and if they
   find, they exploit them which can sometime lead to identity theft or
   financial loss. It’s best to learn how vulnerability scans work and how
   to use tools that can identify weak spots in your computer, network or
   website. This will enable you seal those vulnerabilities before a
   hacker sneaks in.

   Some tools used to defend your computer, network or website, are the
   same tools used to attack. The most common and widely used
   vulnerability scanners are: Nessus, GFI LAN guard, Cain and Abel, Blues
   Port Scanner and WireShark.

   Cain and Abel

   It is available for free and being used by everybody, good or bad. It
   combines all the tools together. Cain and Abel will scan for open
   ports, sniff the network, crack or decrypt passwords, Poison ARP
   (Address Resolution Protocol) or record VOIP calls. Cain and Abel has a
   GUI and is based on Windows OS.

   Nessus

   Available both in retail and free versions with the free version
   intended for home use. Nessus server simulates attacks targeting your
   computer and also scans for vulnerabilities on your computer or home
   network. You can scan for backdoors, possible denial of service
   attacks, missing important system patches and password strength.

   After Nessus is through scanning your computer or network. It will
   display a detailed report on the findings and also give your severity
   levels and possible solutions. When using Nessus, enable auto update
   every 24 hrs. This will give you the most recent definitions.

   GFI LANguard

   With a 30 day trial and defaults to a free version limited to 5 IP
   addresses if you don’t buy the commercial version. GFI LANguard works
   just like Nessus but with an option of automatically fixing vulnerable
   areas after a scan. If it finds that your operating system is missing
   some important security updates, hot fixes or patches, it can connect,
   download and install them from Microsoft. When installed together with
   the GFI report pack, it can send you emails about your system security.

   WireShark

   WireShark runs on WinPcap. This product collects all the data
   transmitted on a wired link (Ethernet) and if you want to sniff on
   wireless networks, you add AirPcaP. WinPcap drivers extend the
   operating system enabling low-level network access. It also has a
   library used to access network layers at the low-level. This is a
   perfect tool for network traffic analysis.

   An effective way of using Cain and Able is by combining it with
   WireShark. After WireShark sniffs a network link save the file and
   analyze with Cain and Abel.
