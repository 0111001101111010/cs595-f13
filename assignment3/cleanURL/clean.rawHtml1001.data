Chemistry's Biggest Loser: Official Atomic Weights Change For 19 Elements

   The periodic table gets a few tweaks.
   By

   The Periodic Table of the Elements, by electronic structure
   Alison Haigh

   Cadmium, are you looking a bit chubbier these days?

   Improved measurements of different elements and their isotopes have
   changed the official atomic weights of 19 elements, the
   [51]International Union of Applied Chemistry and the [52]U.S.
   Geological Survey announced today. The changes are relatively small,
   and they're part of a regular effort to update atomic weights.

   Here's a vocab refresher in case you've forgotten your high school (or
   college) chemistry. Every atom of an element—let's take silver as an
   example—has the same number of protons. Silver has 47. However, not
   every atom of an element necessarily has the same number of neutrons.
   These different versions of an element's atoms are called isotopes.
   Silver occurs as silver-109 and silver-107. Chemists calculate the
   atomic weight of an element that you see on the periodic table from the
   masses of its isotopes, giving more common isotopes more weight than
   less common isotopes.

   That doesn't necessarily mean every sample of silver on Earth has an
   atomic weight of exactly 107.86822, however. Instead, samples of
   elements vary from place to place. These differences play an important
   role in many sciences. They help chemists trace the origin of different
   materials (Where does my groundwater come from?) and date
   archaeological findings. The latest atomic weights measurements differ
   too little from their predecessors to really change science now… but
   you never know, says Norman Holden, a nuclear physicist with the U.S.'
   Brookhaven National Laborary.

   "If it's just small changes, why do you do it?" he tells Popular
   Science. "We've always felt that we should give the best numbers there
   are because we can't predict when some new idea will come up that needs
   more accurate data."

   So this isn't exactly a radical announcement. Nevertheless, we
   figured—why not take a look at some of this update's biggest losers and
   gainers? Here are the tops:

Biggest Losers

   have units)

Biggest Gainers

   The changes in weights mostly come from continuing improvements in
   atomic mass measurements, including advances in the technology behind
   mass spectrometers. But it's not all about measuring more accurately.
   For one of our biggest losers, thorium, the IUPAC decided to recognize
   an isotope, thorium-230, that it previously thought was too rare to
   include in atomic weight calculations.

   The last time international chemistry agencies really altered the
   periodic table was in 2009, when IUPAC decided to list the atomic
   weights of some elements as ranges, instead of single numbers. The
   change affected a number of low-mass elements, such as hydrogen,
   nitrogen, carbon and sulfur. The ranges show students the possible
   atomic weights for each element, which can vary depending on the origin
   of the element. You can print a [62]copy of the IUPAC's peroidic table
   for free.

   "We wanted to let high school students and college students know that
   atomic weights are not constants of nature," says Tyler Coplen, a U.S.
   Geological Survey chemist who works on isotopes research and official
   atomic weights changes. "This is the way we did that, by giving them
   interval atomic weight values."

   Updated: This post originally had the biggest losers and biggest
   gainers reversed (!!). I made my calculations in an Excel sheet and had
   reversed the "old weights" and "new weights" columns. I apologize for
   the error. My thanks to Richard Gray of the U.K.'s The Telegraph for
   letting me know about the mistake. -FD
