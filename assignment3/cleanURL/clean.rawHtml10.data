   Published on Sep 24, 2013

   For many companies, understanding what is going on in your business
   involves lots of data. But, how do you query 10s of billions of data
   points? How can a company begin to make sense of so much information?
   Ville Tuulos, Principle Engineer at AdRoll, a company producing tons of
   big data, demonstrates how AdRoll uses Python to squeeze every bit of
   performance out of a single high-end server. They manage it with Numba,
   a new NumPy aware dynamic Python compiler based on LLVM, and thanks to
   Python, the system can provide a very expressive and developer-friendly
   API. Find out more in this informative talk from the San Francisco
   Python Meetup Group.
