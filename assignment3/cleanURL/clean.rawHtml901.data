Guest Rant: Ham Radio — Hackers’ Paradise

   Editor’s Note: This is a guest post written by [Bill Meara]

   The suits at Hack-a-Day reached out to [16]SolderSmoke HQ and asked me
   to send in a few words about why their readers should take a fresh look
   at ham radio. Here goes:

   First, realize that today’s ham radio represents a tremendous
   opportunity for technical exploration and adventure. How about building
   a station (and software) that will allow you to communicate by
   [17]bouncing digital signals off the moon? How about developing [18]a
   new modulation scheme to send packets not down the fiber optic network,
   but around the world via the ionosphere, or via ham radio’s [19]fleet
   of satellites? How about bouncing your [20]packets off the trails left
   by meteors? This is not your grandfather’s ham radio.

   You can meet some amazing people in this hobby: [21]Using a very
   hacked-together radio station (my antenna was made from scrap lumber
   and copper refrigerator tubing) [22]I’ve spoken to astronaut hams on
   space stations. Our “low power, slow signal” group includes a ham named
   [23]Joe Taylor. Joe is a radio astronomer who won the Nobel Prize for
   Physics. He’s now putting his software skills to use in the development
   [24]of below-the-noise receiving systems for ham radio. Join me after
   the break for more on the topic.

   When you start looking into amateur radio, don’t be deterred if the
   first hams you meet don’t seem to be as deeply into technology as you
   are. You have to seek out ham radio’s hard-core technical subculture.
   It is here that hackers will find kindred spirits. As in the hacker
   world, there is a kind of informal hierarchy based on technical ability
   and achievement. The FCC licenses have become so easy to get that they
   no longer count for much. But if you’ve built from scratch an entire
   shortwave radio station and use it to shoot the breeze with friends in
   Australia, well, that will win you amateur radio street cred, as will
   the computer skills that you’ll bring to the hobby from the hacker
   world.

   Hackers will probably be pleasantly surprised by ham radio’s very
   strong tradition of mutual support and solidarity. Newcomers are
   welcome and more experienced hams volunteer to serve as mentors.
   Especially among people who build their own gear, we have a strong “my
   junk-box is your junk-box” spirit.

   There is also a wonderful social aspect to the hobby. I have in my
   “shack” [25]a shortwave radio station that I hacked myself from
   junk-box parts. I routinely fire it up and “calling CQ” look for
   someone out there to talk to. The response could come from down the
   street or from the other side of the world. What do we talk about?
   Well, the conversation usually begins with me talking about my amazing
   “homebrew rig” and goes on from there. At the risk of reinforcing a
   stereotype, I’ll note that many of us got into ham radio as teenagers
   in part because we were a bit socially awkward. I suspect that this is
   something that many hackers can identify with. You can make a lot of
   good friends in ham radio.

   If you are passionate about electronic technology and are NOT a ham,
   well, you are missing something important. The Hack-A-Day guys are
   right: You should take a new look at ham radio.

       why do every ham operator uses those abysmal nicknames. can’t we
       use normal nicknames, say from our youtube accouts?

            They are assigned to every radio operator by the fcc or the
            other government authorities in other countries. It is legally
            required to use the one assigned to you.

                 The official name thing only applies to certain
                 frequencies and wattage, and requires an exam, but you
                 also have your open frequencies where you are not bound
                 to a name. And there too you can reach mad distances of
                 course.

                      As a licensed ham, I can positively say that this
                      isn’t true at all. All ham bands, regardless of
                      frequency or power used, require station
                      identification using the assigned call sign at the
                      conclusion of a conversation, and every 10 minutes
                      otherwise (CFR Title 47 part 97.119). There *are*
                      other (non-ham) radio services, like CB, GMRS, MURS,
                      and FRS which don’t require station identification,
                      but you don’t have nearly the same access to
                      frequencies, nor can you design your own radio for
                      those services (radios have to be FCC type
                      accepted).

                           vpoko is correct. When operating as a ham, you
                           must use your ham call sign, per 97.119. You
                           can omit your ham call sign if you’re operating
                           on an unlicensed service, but then you must
                           obey the rules of that service, and your ham
                           radio license doesn’t give you any privileges.
                           I’ll further note that unlicensed radio
                           generally can’t do long distance communication.
                           GMRS, MURS, and FRS are all at frequencies that
                           don’t offer long distance propagation. CB is at
                           a frequency range that does offer “skip” for
                           long distance propagation, but it is illegal to
                           use CB radio to operate over a distance of more
                           than 250km (approximately 155 miles), per CFR
                           47 part 95.413(a)(9). Enforcement of this
                           provision of the CB rules is admittedly scarce.

                           Note that there may be slight variations on the
                           ID timing requirements from country to country,
                           but the basics of at the end of the
                           conversation and periodically durring the
                           conversation always apply. Some countries
                           require it at the beginning as well, but even
                           if it’s not required, it’s good operating
                           practice. For example, stations in Canada only
                           need to ID every 30 minutes and at the
                           beginning and end of the communication. (Per
                           Industry Canada RBR-4 – Standards for the
                           Operation of Radio Stations in the Amateur

                           This is exactly why ham has never been worth it
                           for me. It’s not really mine if I have to ask
                           someone’s permission to use it. I’ll stick to
                           the internet, k thanx.

                           Do you refuse to get a driver’s license for the
                           same reason?
                           Anyway, ham is a great hobby for those
                           interested in the radio art. We like the
                           licensing requirement because it helps to
                           ensure that only people with the requisite
                           technical skills participate. Someone operating
                           incorrectly or with improperly built equipment
                           can quickly ruin the hobby for a lot of other
                           people, so we see licensing as a plus and not a
                           minus. If you want to see what happens without
                           licensing, check out the CB bands in places
                           where they’re still popular. The quality of
                           discourse is on par with Youtube comments.

                           I think our disagreement is a misunderstanding
                           of what falls under the name ‘ham’, where I
                           included your normal CB type of person.
                           And incidentally, if you play around with
                           things like signal transmission and slow scan
                           TV and what not then you can’t send your ID in
                           plenty of cases.

                           You can send an ID with slow-scan TV, and
                           you’re allowed to send it as an image. The only
                           time you’re not required identify, per the
                           rules, is when you’re using ham bands for
                           remote “telecommand of a craft”.

                           One correction is that GMRS is _not_ an
                           unlicensed service. You are required to have a
                           valid GMRS license from the FCC in order to
                           operate in the GMRS radio service. Station
                           identification rules are pretty much identical
                           with GMRS as with the amateur radio bands, with
                           the exception that the callsign is completely
                           different. Source: I am an Extra class amateur
                           radio operator and I hold a GMRS license as
                           well.

                           license requirement (though the FCC has issued
                           a notice of proposed rulemaking to change GMRS
                           licensing to by-rule like CB, FRS, and MURS)
                           but didn’t know there were callsigns.

                      That official name thing is the operator/station
                      call sign issued by the regulating agency of each
                      country. The class of license associated with call
                      sign determine what bands & power levels the
                      licensee can use. open frequencies do not exist
                      where the FCC, regulates the spectrum, except for
                      the unlicensed services. In the US we can use our
                      given times or nicknames or what is known as
                      tactical “call signs”, but we are required to ID
                      using our call sign in a proscribed manner.

                           handles. Ham operators don’t do that. Hams use
                           their real names together with their
                           government-issued (license) callsigns.

                           was an attempt at trolling by deliberately
                           confusing Hams with stereotypical “Smokey and

                           in these parts) is a fairly offensive thing to
                           do to a Ham.
                           Obviously, no one caught on so the joke is on
                           the troll.

                      Most Hams would not include ‘your normal CB type of
                      person’. There are a variety of reasons for that and
                      one can chose to debate it all day long however I
                      think for the purposes of this conversation CB
                      cannot possibly be included.
                      Here in the US and I’m pretty sure in most other
                      countries a CB transmitter may not be legally
                      operated unless it is type accepted. Getting type
                      acceptance is far outside the financial capabilities
                      of any home maker/hacker. Likewise to maintain it’s
                      type acceptance it cannot be modified or repaired by
                      anyone other than a technician authorized by the
                      company that made the device.
                      Also, with mode and power limitations and even a
                      hard set distance limit beyond which it is ilegal to
                      communicate even if your 4-watt legal limit signal
                      manages to get some skip what kind of hacking would
                      you do? With the exception of the antenna and maybe
                      power supply there just isn’t any legal room for
                      hacking in CB.
                      Anyway, my point is that anything specific to CB
                      doesn’t even belong in the conversation because CB
                      isn’t really compatible with hacking anyway.
                      More applicable to the oringinal post about funny
                      names, Ham radio is different from CB in other ways
                      too. Many hams will tell you that things like CB
                      “trucker talk” (10-4 good buddy) and silly handles
                      don’t happen on ham radio.
                      This is mostly true. In the area where I live and in
                      most that I have traveled to a quick listen to the
                      local repeaters gets me real people, having actual
                      natural sounding conversations. Tuning CB I mostly
                      hear people screaming “audiiiioooo audiiioooo ooone
                      twoooo threeeee fouuur… auuudioo audiooo” or else
                      cussing at each other. To be fair, on rare occasion
                      I do hear someone actually talk to somebody else.
                      But… there are bad apples in ham radio too.
                      Unfortunately, on the HF bands where one’s signal
                      can reach worldwide it only takes one and everyone
                      can hear them. So.. you will find some trucker talk,
                      people preaching, going on about government
                      conspiracies, aliens and etc… but… just turn the
                      dial and you will find an actual sane “or at least
                      seemingly sane :-) ” person.
                      Ok, I guess I did get into the ‘you can debate it
                      all day’ reasons why Ham radio is not like CB
                      afterall.. oh well that was more pertinent anyway,
                      let the flame war begin.

                      @whatnot
                      No, using different modes neither prevents nor
                      excuses one from sending their id.
                      You mentioned slow scan. That one is easy. You
                      include your id as part of the picture you send.
                      For various digital modes such as packet, APRS,
                      DSTAR your call sign is part of the headers in the
                      packets you send. It’s kind of nice because you
                      don’t have to even think about sending it. It’s
                      already there.
                      the same kind of thing goes with any mode. Usually
                      you just send your id the same way as you send your
                      data although sometimes, such as when experimenting
                      with a new digital mode you might id by switching to
                      cw and sending it in morse to meet the requirement.
                      When using an SSB transmitter that ability can be
                      built right into software, you only need to send a
                      steady tone.
                      The one time were hams might legally not id is
                      really low power modes like QRSS.* The only reason
                      they get away with not iding then isn’t because
                      there is any exception built into ham radio rules.
                      It’s because at such low power they can fall under
                      part 15(US) rules. That’s an entirely different
                      radio service, not ham radio. It’s the same rules
                      that allow for things like wifi and cordless phones
                      without a license.
                      Part 15 (unlike CB) is another way hackers/makers
                      can experiment with radio as homemade equipment is
                      allowed. It is extremely limited what one can do
                      with part15 compared to ham radio though. Ham
                      licenses are easy to get and allow for much much
                      more.
                      * Really slow cw (morse code) that takes several
                      minutes to just send a word, people experiment with
                      it because by keeping the bandwidth down you can
                      sometimes reach over 1000 km with a tiny fraction of
                      a watt.

            I assume you’re referring to the call sign? That’s assigned by
            the government, and it’s what hams are required to use on the
            air to identify their transmissions. It’s often used in other
            contexts, as well. It’s relatively short, and guaranteed to be
            unique worldwide. It immediately tells other hams your
            country, and sometimes your approximate location within the
            country. Hams can look up a call sign to find the name and
            home location of the operator. Some hams put their call sign
            on their license plate. More than one has it on his tombstone.

            Some “handles” (nicknames) are mnemonics to help others
            remember their “call sign”.
            Just as WNBC is an FCC required call sign for a
            television/radio station, K5WL is the call sign of the poster
            above. Transmissions need to include call signs. So, to help
            other hams remember K5WL, the above poster may refer to
            him(?)self as “Ken’s 5 Wild Ladies” or “Kentucky’s 5 Whiskey
            Lovers”.

            I wonder who the first fool was to comply with this absurd
            notion that a “government” should grant itself the rights to
            control and oversee electronic frequencies. The FCC control
            over electronic airways was the very first NSA tracking and
            censorship program. The entire system was devised so they
            would know exactly who was talking about what and with who.
            This entire system should be derailed and overrun with
            non-compliance.

                 RF spectrum is limited. That’s why we have rules about
                 it. It is doubtful that much communication could be done
                 over all the interference if we had anarchy in radio.
                 That includes all those things some people seem to forget
                 are radio btw, like tv, cellphone, etc… There would be
                 too many people ‘shouting’ on the same frequencies.
                 As for ‘tracking and censorship’, I guess you are talking
                 about rules like not being able to use codes and cyphers
                 to obscure the meaning of your communication in ham
                 radio… Hams are actually some of the biggest supporters
                 of keeping that rule. look at the demand for bandwidth
                 these days for wireless internet. Without that rule we
                 would have milions using ham frequencies for surfing the
                 web overnight. Then the bands would be so full nobody
                 could really use them for anything.
                 “overrun with non-compliance.”… I think you are
                 advocating protest through civil disobedience here… That
                 may work for some things but I wouldn’t recommend it. You
                 had better do your homework first, this isn’t just a
                 night in jail. The fines involved can be huge!!!
                 Despite disagreeing with your idea that all RF spectrum
                 should be without rules I might vote for a single band
                 designated that way given the chance. Of course.. there
                 would be one rule. Your signal must not interfere with
                 anything out of band! It would probably be too full of
                 interference to be very useful but overcoming that
                 interference could be a good technological challenge to
                 spur further development. Then again.. that’s kind of
                 what CB became and yet it didn’t have that result.

                           The ARRL does not issue licenses. Only the FCC
                           does that. The licensing system uses unpaid
                           volunteers who are certified through any of
                           several groups (in my case, 2 different ones,
                           ARRL and W5YI) and are legally responsible to
                           keep the exams honest. Since I can’t pay a
                           $10,000 fine and don’t care to lose my license
                           for a decade, I make sure to give applicants
                           exactly the grade they merit.
                           The ARRL is simply the largest of several ham
                           radio groups around the world. The membership
                           fee mainly gets you a magazine subscription and
                           regular reminders to congress that there are

                 As soon as the Federal government realized that Marconi’s
                 (or Telsa’s) silly idea of modulating hertz waves to
                 deliver information, and most of them were spark gap
                 devices, they felt that these individuals needed to keep
                 to a specific region. Yes it is annoying and possibly
                 violates both common sense and the founding beliefs
                 behind our country, but this is years before the NSA was
                 even considered. Especially since spark gap devices
                 produce large quantities of waves with little or no
                 information embedded in them. Study what happens when a
                 lightning bolt gets delivered and you’ll see most of what
                 I mean.

                      Same reason why railroads came up with the concept
                      of time zones. They prevented collisions between
                      trains.
                      The FCC and other radio spectrum governing agencies
                      were created to make rules and guidelines to prevent
                      collisions amongst different transmissions.
                      Spark gap transmitters blasted out across wide
                      swaths of the RF spectrum, within the transmitter’s
                      effective range there could be only one. Mostly they
                      were used just for transmitting Morse code because
                      they were very difficult to modulate for voice.

                           Yep. It cut down the amount of timetables each
                           rail company had to calculate and print, when

                           than morning / afternoon / night.
                           There was an interesting documentary a while
                           back, for a long while there was a woman in
                           London who was paid to start her rounds at (I
                           think) the Greenwhich observatory. She carried
                           the most accurate portable clock she could
                           reasonably use. Over the day she’d travel
                           between subscribing businesses, telling them
                           the time so they could synchronise their
                           clocks.

                           What’s interesting, though, is that the Rugby

                           signal worldwide from 1926 on. I wonder why
                           businesses either didn’t tap into this, or that
                           businesses weren’t set up specifically for
                           receiving this signal. Seems much more

                           The business was started in 1836 by Ruth’s
                           father. After he died, his wife, then his
                           daughter Ruth took over. Ruth herself ran it
                           from 1892 – 1940, when she retired at 86! She
                           lived til she was 90.
                           There’s some interesting stuff about her on the
                           web. A competitor (without revealing such) made
                           a disparaging speech, later printed in The
                           Times, laughing at how out of date it all was.
                           Reporters besieged her after this, for her
                           interesting story, and the possible rivalry.
                           After it all died down she had more customers
                           than ever.
                           And the moral is… the British love an underdog!
                           Well, when it’s presented in the right way we
                           do. I think that might be responsible for her
                           14 years of work after Rugby started up, who’s
                           going to tell a 72 year old lady to stuff her
                           watch up her arse? They must have guessed she’d
                           retire soon enough, and after all the years of
                           providing an important service. Stuff like that
                           used to be worth something.

                           Ah right, I’ve just seen what you mean… why
                           didn’t Ruth herself buy a radio? I might guess
                           cos they weren’t cheap back then, and possibly
                           she thought it was more technical stuff than
                           she could deal with. Clocks and old ladies are
                           both well-known and trusted technology.
                           I suppose she could’ve phoned Greenwich up
                           herself. But there’s a nice story and a sense
                           of ceremony in going to Greenwich to get the
                           time in person. It also isn’t that far from the
                           centre of London, it’s no trip, really, and the
                           Underground and London’s other public transport
                           was going well by that point.
                           I think the sense of ceremony and authority,
                           and kindness to Ruth, are what drove most of
                           the market towards the end, and also the reason
                           why nobody bothered taking the business up
                           after she retired.

                 It’s not a US thing. Since radio waves don’t respect
                 national boundaries, there have been rules and licensing
                 regulations in place by international treaties since at
                 least 1906. It didn’t take long for radio users to
                 realize that coordination was needed, or else a few bad
                 operators would spoil the bands for everyone.

                 drive on the left one, why shouldn’t I be able to? It’s
                 called freedom! The spectrum should just be a free for
                 all. Sure, no one could use it except maybe a few
                 very-well heeled corporations with budgets for megawatt
                 transmitters, but at least we’d be free. Am I right

                      If all were allowed to use the spectrum as they
                      like, you would soon have congestion & soon no one
                      will be able to use anything.
                      I find it a bit hypocritical that you are ready to
                      use a mobile phone (limited to its own freq. bands)
                      or internet (again limited/regulated IP addresses

                 from us specific frequencies and powers. Then we can open

                 Those fools where the predecessors of today’s amateur

                 That’s a bit daft, I work using RF cameras in live TV
                 broadcasting, and we have very tight regulations on
                 bandwidth, frequency and power, for good reasons.
                 During the Queens Jubilee, folks were nipping over the
                 Channel to London with unlicenced RF equipment and firing
                 it up and interfering with us, it was a bit of a free for
                 all.
                 It would be completely irresponsible for some idiot to
                 fire up on any frequency just because they think they
                 shouldn’t be restricted.
                 We need the regulations to keep everything in order.
                 Without them it would be completely abused.. Try using RF
                 in other countries without the laws and see how far you
                 get..

            What a coincidence. I had been contemplating a ham radio

            In the U.S., [168]http://www.arrl.org/ is a great resource,
            and for study guides I would suggest
            [169]http://www.kb6nu.com/tech-manual/ . The technician (1st
            level ), and general (2nd level), are pretty much stupid
            simple, it usually costs about $15 to get tested each time,
            and doesn’t take much time at all. Though, the extra class
            (3rd and final level) licence is effectively a course on
            AC/DC/RF theory, though most everyone now is usually just a
            general class operator because the extra spectrum most often
            isn’t worth it.

            They haven’t required CW for VHF and above for on the order of
            two decades (Code-Free Technician, which I got in middle
            school or high school in the mid-1990s), but you did need to
            know CW for HF and below – that requirement’s removal is

            There’s no need to even think of Morse code for a US ham
            license any more. That was dropped when the last of the
            international treaties requiring it expired. It was finally
            declared unnecessary when the last branch of the US military
            dropped Morse code nearly 10 years ago. The Technician class
            license test now pretty much proves you can read and write,
            have read the FCC regulations, and can identify symbols on a
            circuit diagram. There are kids as young as 4 passing this
            exam. You’re limited (except for a couple of CW bands) to
            frequencies above 50 MHz, so your range is limited to about
            half a million miles (bouncing it off the moon), or 3,000
            miles in certain conditions with a decent antenna. If you
            settle for a handheld radio, you’re limited to about 20 miles
            direct, 250 miles to the International Space Station, or about
            500 miles using one of about 70 ham satellites. Those
            distances assume your handheld radio puts out 5 watts, a bit
            less than a night light. You can also design, build, and use
            your own TV stations, with your FCC call sign included as a
            caption in the picture.

            There are study materials and practice tests at
            [226]http://www.qrz.com that will get you ready for the exam,
            and the FCC rules are publicly available as CFR 47 part 97.
            The ARRL and W5YI-VEC web sites include lists of upcoming
            exams listed by date and location. In many cases, these are
            monthly sessions.
            At a given exam session, there may be tests given for all 3
            levels of license. Also, there is a processing fee (under $15)
            charged. If you pass the lowest level exam, you get to try the
            next level, and if you pass that, you can take the top level
            exam, all for that one fee. If you fail an exam, you can pay
            the fee again, retake the exam (the exact questions will be
            different) and possibly pass. Most VE groups have 5 different
            tests for each license level. You start using your license as
            soon as you show up in the FCC database.
            NOTE: If you don’t like the callsign they assign, you can pay
            a fee to get a vanity call of any available one legal for your
            level of license.

       CW is no longer required for achieving a ham radio license. If you
       want more information about how to get involved, visit
       [230]http://www.arrl.org/getting-licensed. There are three
       different licenses available for Radio Amateurs. The Technician
       class license, the first in the sequence, gives you access to the
       VHF and UHF bands and a small portion of the 10m frequency band.
       This is mostly used for local communications, as well as
       satellites, moon-bounce, and remote control. The next level gives
       you access to long distance communication in the 10m through 180m
       bands. This allows round the world transmission.

       Most hams tend to be very friendly about their hobby and they

            In the United States there is a 35 question test that gives
            you privileges on the bands. There is a published question
            pool and you only need 75% correct to pass the test. It
            constitutes mostly of the rules governing the use of the
            radios and is relatively easy.
            I highly recommend the Ham Radio License Manual which can be
            found on amazon or at the local library.

       Becoming a ham is very easy these days.
       To take your test you need to find a club, most clubs have VEs
       (examiners) who can give you the test. The ARRL has a great search
       tool to find local clubs, keep in mind there are clubs not working
       with the ARRL so Google is another good place to look.
       ARRL Club Search: [239]http://www.arrl.org/find-a-club
       The test is about $14USD to take and if time is available if you
       pass your technician class (the lowest class available) you can
       take the next two class tests at no extra charge.
       There are 3 classes.
       Technician: UHF/VHF Bands- Local communications with a small 10m
       band HF portion.
       General: All the radio bands except for a few dedicated CW spaces
       on HF.
       Extra: You get those extra CW spaces, and you can become a VE
       yourself.
       I went to [240]http://hamtestonline.com to take my practice exams,
       but QRZ has free practice tests if you don’t want to pay the
       hamtestonline fees.

            You don’t need AE to be a VE. You can be a VE for any class
            below what you have. Eg, I have a General, and I could VE for

       It’s something I’ve been wanting to so for some time. Now I’m

       Hey! The FCC license is easy to get, but it remains a barrier to
       entry. When CB usage was deregulated CB licensees all over
       complained, but for those who just want to talk on plug-and-play
       equipment it’s a fabulous thing.
       I enjoy having a license and the privileges it grants. One nice

       I’ll agree with Bill Meara’s points and add a few from my own
       perspective. I’ve always been an electronics tinkerer, and I had a
       shortwave radio since age 10 or so. As a kid, I never had the
       perseverance to master Morse Code, so I never got a ham license. A
       bit less than a year ago I found out that there was no more
       requirement for code for any class of license. Within a week of
       discovering that bit of info, I had passed the exam for my Extra
       class license, which gives me full privileges to operate any mode
       on any ham bands. Since then, I’ve built radios and antennas, and
       had a blast. And I’m even learning the Morse Code, because it’s
       still a very efficient way to send a signal for a long distance
       with low power. I’ve “talked” over 6000 miles using just five watts
       bouncing off the ionosphere.
       The license is very easy, at least in the USA. Start at
       [269]http://www.arrl.org and click the
       “licensing/education/training” tab. If you’re the technical type
       who reads Hack-a-Day, the electronics theory part will be easier
       for you than most. You still need to learn the operating rules and
       practices, but those aren’t hard. Most cities have ham clubs that
       will teach classes, but you can self-study if you prefer.
       There are many non-technical hams. There are some semi-technical
       hams who have experience about what kinds of equipment works well,
       without much understanding about why (there are many useful pearls
       of wisdom to be learned from this type of ham). But there are some
       who are extremely technical, and they can teach you a lot. There
       are lots of opportunities both for learning and for advancing the
       state of the art.
       Speaking of the state of the art, there are so many little obscure
       niches in the world of ham radio that it would take a few lifetimes
       to explore them all. There’s no requirement to progress through a
       certain sequence in order.

       I was a CB brat back in the late 60′s. Big deal then was running a
       ham rig that you converted to work on 11 meters(CB band). Thats
       where I got bit by the bug. I bought & built a Heathkit station &
       converted it. I still have that gear! Never could master Morse
       code. Now I finally got my ‘ticket’ that code is no longer
       required. It is a great, rewarding hobby. I highly recommend it.

                 If the existing local club is well established it would
                 probably work out better to join them and then start
                 leading some activities yourself. There are probably
                 others there who would be interested in more hands on
                 building and experimenting. Just come up with a few ideas
                 for simple starter projects and offer to lead a build
                 night after a regular meeting now and then. Others you
                 didn’t expect will come out of the woodwork and do the
                 same. That way you get one stronger club which is good
                 for both kinds of activities, not two clubs that compete
                 for members dividing the community.

                      station somewhere, or operates a repeater (or
                      several), there’s usually a technical committee in

                           I gues you could talk to the tech comittee.
                           They are probably most likely to be interested
                           in the technical side.
                           I was thinking more just putting on something
                           at the end of the general meetings. I don’t
                           know about every other club but the one I am in
                           is always looking for content, presentations
                           for the meetings. They want something for
                           people to go for beyond just the regular new
                           business/ old business parlimentary procedure.
                           There’s no official, regularly scheduled
                           building but if someone wants to have a build
                           night they are up for it. You just have to come
                           up with what you want to build, find a design
                           for it somewhere, preferably not too expensive
                           and small enough to build in an hour or two.
                           Then, pick a month (oour meetings our monthly).
                           Anounce it ahead of time and have people sign
                           up / bring money for the parts. Have the parts
                           sorted and ready to go the day of the build.
                           Also, ask people that can bring extra soldering
                           irons to do so to loan to those who don’t have
                           any.
                           i think you might do better in general meetings
                           like that because likely the tech comittee
                           people will all be there but also anyone else
                           who might be interested but for one reason or
                           another is not on the tech comittee might be

       Oh, and not to forget: being a HAM ain’t that bad in job
       interviews, either. I am working as a software engineer (embedded)
       and all my employers either were HAMs themselves or did understand
       the meaning. Being able to state my call-sign (DG9FAB,btw) always
       gave me the credibility that I could touch a soldering iron w/o
       hurting myself. Maybe that’s one day the thing that distinguishes
       you from the other applicants…

            Definitely. You might not be able to legally make money
            directly for operating an amateur station, however you can end
            up with contacts and even experience that get you jobs.

                 I’m mildly involved with emergency preparedness locally
                 (County level ARES RO), I do my best not to overstated
                 what the local ham community can do, while not
                 understating our capabilities. I have to be curious as to
                 what you mean your “neck of the woods” Are you speaking
                 of your area of residence or at your workplace or both?
                 Nearby a ham was a law enforcement dispatcher. He rubbed
                 some in the PD the wrong way, but he also did a lot to
                 get that counties ARES?RACES group obtain professionalism
                 as well the group did earn letters of commendation from
                 agencies in adjoining counties for mutual aid activities
                 well done. Sometimes the doers can’t make everyone happy.

                 It depends on how you approach the subject, Bullmoose.
                 I’ve actually received jobs in that community because I
                 am a ham. I was recruited by FEMA for the response to
                 Charley/Frances/Ivan/Jean via the ARES (Amateur Radio
                 Emergency Service) group in my area, because we had a
                 good working relationship with our local EMA. That same
                 group is also how I became involved in the disaster
                 response team I currently am on, which at the time I
                 became involved was a part of FEMA, and ham equipment is
                 specifically verbotten to use in that group. (something
                 about us using NTIA spectrum instead of FCC spectrum, and
                 HIPAA compliance…) Also, I received my current job
                 because of my involvement in the ARPSC (Amateur Radio
                 Public Service Corps, basically a hybrid of ARES and
                 RACES), and this started with another local EMA, working
                 under a grant in a nuclear county…

       I’ve been working for a number of years to help bring together the
       ham and DIY/Maker communities, and before that trying to get the
       various online communities (like Slashdot back in the day) to
       recognize that hams are the ones who preserved the DIY spirit
       through the dark ages of the 1970′s – 2000 when closed-box consumer
       electronics gizmos took over from things you could make and repair
       yourself. I’ve been luck enough to have been part of ham activities
       at the SF Maker Faire (organized by others) and to bring some of
       those projects here to Hack-a-day (Marauder’s Map and Cascata).
       Out of that effort came a book of ham radio and Arduino and Picaxe
       projects, published by the ARRL, which is non-profit. I don’t get
       any money when the ARRL sells a copy, but I edited the book and
       collected my own and others’ projects together to try to bring
       communities together, so please do take a look.

       I recently got my technicians license and its good to see an
       article like this here – i agree wholeheartedly that radio is a
       hackers paradise – one that is relatively untapped by the hackaday
       style community — so, a lot of potential for interesting work. In
       some ways hack a day planted the seed of my interest in radio
       through the articles on sdr. I started experimenting with the usb
       tv receivers as radios and the interest grew from there.
       getting through the test is easy – get the arrl book at the library
       and read it. I talked to a friend at work with an arrl calendar in
       his cube one day and he gave me a copy of the book the next day —
       elmer for the win.
       after you study take the test for $15 at a local radio club. google
       it. you will pass. study more and go for the general class (much
       more hf privilege) if you want. when you pass on one test the next
       one(s) are free in the same sitting.
       with a tech license you have privileges in uhf, vhf and limited in
       some hf bands. radios are cheap. check out the baofeng uv-5r
       handheld — about $35. It will get you on local 2 meter (144mhz) and
       70cm bands. you can also build antennas that will allow this radio
       to make contacts via satellite (one one so-50 today for this radio,
       but more are apparently coming via cubesats) or if youre lucky,
       contact the ISS. Working on a three element tape measure yagi now.
       I also picked up a 6 meter qrp (low power) mfj-9406. Pretty late to
       the party this season, but it’ll be worth the wait. I put together
       a telescoping dipole for this – check out youtube for a few good
       examples.
       Right now I wish I would have gotten on ten meters first though
       since right now we’re at a high point (peaking at a 100 yr low btw)
       in the 11 yr solar cycle – during this time very long distance
       contacts (world scale) are possible with relatively low power. a
       slice of the ssb (voice) section of this band is accessible to the
       technician class and there are single band radios available for
       around $100 made by realistic/radio shack.
       i went to a local ham club meeting and the members were all nice –
       seemed like a small community of members that was tightly knit.
       there was a pretty large age gap between me and many of them
       (generations) but it was interesting how the interest can span the
       gap. it was not unlike meetings I have been to at a local
       hackerspace.
       there is so much potential for this hacker diy community to make
       their mark on the hobby — i would suspect that it could even steer
       the future of the hobby if adopted.

       I have recently got into ham by trying to understand how to get
       long range communication between two Arduinos. I have always been a
       programmer/hacker only building using known simple analog and MCUs
       ICs. I started by taking apart a cheap $35 5W radio, and replacing
       its cpu ( [347]http://hackaday.com/2013/02/28/hacking-a-ham-radio/
       ). In the process I learned more about RF and Morse code (the
       original binary protocol). Since then, I have built inexpensive SDR
       radios and was able to send signals directly from California to
       Georgia with only 0.5W (No repeaters, just bouncing RF off the
       Ionosphere on 10m). Talk about long distance.
       As a side note of learning Morse, I started placing a single LED
       and a touch switch (made from a PCB trace) on all my PCBs for use
       in debugging. The MCU sends me status during startup, or ongoing
       messages in Morse on the LED and I can interact with the MCU using
       the touch switch. No need for bulky LCD displays, or having the
       thing hooked up to your computer.
       Just my 10 bits.

       “At the risk of reinforcing a stereotype, I’ll note that many of us
       got into ham radio as teenagers in part because we were a bit
       socially awkward. I suspect that this is something that many
       hackers can identify with.”
       Since no one has backed you up on this – yep, I can identify.
       But at that age for me, you needed Morse code proficiency to
       qualify for a license that didn’t restrict your ability to access
       the spectrum for voice communications. It seemed elitist and
       archaic, and if the regulations were that way, perhaps the people
       the hobby attracted were predominantly that way too. While in
       retrospect I realize that was an unfair assumption, it was enough
       to turn me off from the hobby. I set up a BBS instead, got a CB
       radio (I miss games of Possum Hunt), and so on. By the time I
       discovered the licensing requirements had been relaxed, I could no
       longer muster my original enthusiasm, and my time and budget were
       filled with other things.
       Just relating a story, not knocking the hobby. Glad to see so much
       interest in it. Even though I’ll probably never be a Ham, living
       through events like Hurricane Katrina have given me additional
       respect for it.

       I’ve been a HAM since august. For me, the greatest thing about it
       is that I can build my own transmitter and experiment as much as I
       want. Using WSPR, I’ve been heard 17,000 km away with a peaberry
       SDR kit I built, sending with 1W of power. Using gnuradio, I’ve
       been getting my feet wet in DSP.
       I can agree with the article: if you’re addicted to the smell of
       soldering, get a HAM license. It’s fun! There’s a lot happening in
       the field. Maybe just visit some local clubs, find the homebrewing
       people and you’ll be amazed by their competence. And they’re eager
       to pass on their knowledge.The HAM and hacker cultures have so much
       to offer each other, yet until now, they haven’t really connected.
       It’s very, very unfortunate, IMO.
       PS: In order to train, I wrote a HAREC test program, available here
       in case it can help someone: [357]http://hansvi.be/harec.php (only

       My experience in Ham Radio is nowhere near what I’m reading here. I
       wish it was. The major club in the area is a group of 300+ folks
       that are waiting for the end of days, and ham radio is one way to
       prepare. Aluminum foil hats, open-carry “patriots” who openly talk
       about when the government collapses how they’ll be there. The
       technical knowledge was chased out, and replaced with
       self-righteous inbreds all looking for something that fulfills
       their desire to feel important without any need to know something.
       I joined and got my license with the idea I’d find a group of
       like-minded tinkerers with an interest in the technical things that
       make all their magic store-bought black voice machines work. I
       thought I’d find bleeding edge. I found the definition of
       “high-tech” being technology that’s already been a minimum 20+
       years in the commercial world. I’ve looked around, and found
       nothing else around here. The don’t regulate, they don’t follow
       simplest of Amateur Radio requirements such as use no more power
       than necessary. 50W into a 4-bay 9dBi gain folded dipole on an APRS
       digipeater servicing a city from an 7600ft overlooking mountaintop
       for example. I’ll get off my soapbox now. I guess I’m jealous you
       all have had a decent experience. Here, don’t show up without a

            I’m not certain what area you are in, but you might want to
            try talking to your SEC about this. There are a few people
            like that around here, but our SEC is really working to
            improve the image, and people like that are generally turned
            around when they try showing up for something because of the
            image they present. Unless you have a need for a light bar,
            such as if you are a volunteer firefighter, or drive a truck
            that is equipped as a snow plow, you shouldn’t have a light

                 Unfortunately, the SEC is on board with it. We’ve had one
                 too many Hams “self-deploy” to emergencies such as house
                 fires, then act like they own the incident. It’s more
                 than one loon in the bunch too. The running response from
                 the local Ham community is “it’s a free country, and he’s
                 a volunteer, there’s nothing we can do”, Suffice to say,
                 the entire Ham community is banned, local ARES has zero
                 serving organizations, and Ham is usually followed by

       As much as it would be awesome to see the hacker/maker/diy

       would be a collision of two utterly opposite worlds. I think this

       brand of antenna, etc.. and 1% people shouting horrifying racist or
       inflammatory ultra-rightwing political stuff. It’s really
       disappointing, because it could be so much more. And it’s not a
       community that welcomes new people or embraces any kind of change.
       About the only common ground is a sense of wonder at being able to
       convey information over huge distances with no infrastructure in
       between. I think there was a big boom in ham radio in the 1950s
       when it was very cutting-edge and was often the only way of
       communication between point A and point B – that community is
       growing old and I think the culture will change greatly as that
       side of it dies out. Both good and bad – it really was a sort of
       cameraderie of a kind that I don’t think could ever arise again in
       the modern age – but on the other hand, it is or has been very much
       stuck in the past, bound by a culture that the world has passed by.
       The reality is that in this age of the internet and satellite
       communication, ham has very little concrete, practical utility –
       you really have to stretch to contrive a situation where it’s the
       only thing that will solve a given problem. It isn’t any less cool
       or interesting for that — it just needs to be seen for what it is –
       something really cool and interesting and endlessly complex that
       you can do all sort of things with. It’s a pity that the standard
       reaction is “wow, people still do that?”

            I agree that the majority of hams aren’t the sort to build
            their own equipment, at least not on any substantial level or
            scale. However, there are many thousands of us who do, you
            just have to seek them out.
            We’re widely scattered enough that you won’t often find a
            local club with a strong hacker subculture, except in specific
            environments like STEM schools or extremely tech-heavy areas.
            The most active groups by far are online, but you *can* find
            many of those folks by going to hamfests, especially the big
            ones. If you go to Dayton or Orlando, you realize pretty
            quickly that there are far more than you’d suppose just by
            talking to folks on the air.
            The biggest thing I’ve noticed is that many of the hackers in
            the hobby are highly specialized. Some guys do transmitters,
            some (like me) do antennas and other station hardware, some
            toy with the digital end and write software or develop new
            modes. Some just build kits. I think the hacker culture in ham
            radio is a bit more nebulous because each of those groups
            tends to keep to themselves in large part.
            I do want to say thoug, If you want to find the sure fire
            hardware hackers, find the satellite operators, and the
            backpack QRP operators. Those are the guys who come up with
            some wickedly innovative hardware out of necessity.

            It’s true that if you listen to the amateur bands you find a
            lot of mostly older, male hams talking about their day, what
            they had for lunch, etc. They’re certainly the ones making
            most use of bands if you go purely by air time. But there are
            other kinds of hams, too, making use of their license without
            chatting on the air for hours on end about nothing in
            particular.
            Me, personally, I’m interested in radio as an extension of my
            interest in electronics. I like learning about receivers,
            antennas, transmitters, etc, and trying out what I learn. For
            me, getting on for a quick signal report is all the talking I
            care to do on the radio. Having the license lets me use the
            frequencies for what I want to use them for – experimenting on
            radios. It’s not a communication medium for me. I feel like
            it’s a very exciting time in radio. Software Defined Radio is
            huge, it moves an amazing amount technology into the hands of
            any enthusiast who’s interested. Plus with WiFi, cellular,
            Bluetooth, and all the other heavily used radio technologies
            around, it’s not like learning about the science of radio is a
            waste of time.

       We have a lot of good replies here (as well as the standard
       naysayers, apparently) and I’ll put QRZ.com on the pile of great
       sites. To get started, find your local ham club, and take the
       practice test for the tech license about 50 times. By the time
       you’ve done that, you’ll have a pretty good grasp on the rules and
       should be able to pass the test no problem. Most of the tech level
       test is common sense, such as how to handle emergency callers (the
       answer is “shut up and ask if they need help”). Once you have your
       tech license, hang out with your local club, operate, then see if
       you want to continue. The real fun (for some) begins with the
       general class and talking to people *thousands* of miles away. last
       week I talked to someone in Zagreb, Croatia from my home in
       Indiana. 4,800 miles with a wire antenna hanging on my house. It
       feels awesome.

       People resources. Over the years I knew a former engineer with ATT,
       another that worked at Bell labs as an engineer Radio/electronics
       professionals, University physics professor machinists welders, on
       and on. Not to mention a huge collective junk box or tool library.

       Ham radio has always been an interest of mine right from childhood,
       I remember when I used to dream about talking to far off contacts
       while reading about it in the library, I sometimes think of it as
       the first “internet” albeit for more technically oriented people
       especially the home-brewers. 10+ years later and I’m still dreaming
       of being a Ham, this post is a reminder to me that I have to get to
       work on making that dream a reality!

       “At the risk of reinforcing a stereotype, I’ll
       note that many of us got into ham radio as
       teenagers in part because we were a bit socially
       awkward”. Even though I’m no more a teen the risk with me is zero
       because I TOTALLY fit that stereotype. You can’t get more
       introverted than me (or so I think). That’s part of the reason why
       I am more comfortable chatting online than meeting people face to
       face because of that electronic barrier between me and the other
       person, and I think ham will work for me in that regard. I don’t
       know why but I am usually in my element when I’m all alone. My
       mother is always encouraging me to change though, she says it is
       important that i learn how to comfortably interact with others (or
       maybe she is afraid I won’t bring her a daughter-in-law and
       eventually some grandchildren *shudders*. I know she wants what’s
       best for me). But then I am also learning for myself that you can’t
       do without others and some level of social skills is necessary.

       I have a ham license, yet I don’t really use it beyond some of the
       side benefits it offers. And I’d never use it on a resume due to
       the fact its an over played hand by many people who want a tech
       related job and blabbing on about ham radio gets annoying really
       fast to a lot of people who see it as a glorified cell / telephone
       anyway. Don’t get me wrong, It’s great when the hiring manager is a
       fellow ham, but the reality is that most are not even technical
       people to start with, let alone ham operators! Your milage may
       vary. Also a lot of the hams I know think their license makes them
       an authority on everything to do with electronics and beyond, yet I
       have taken the tech and general exams and they really aren’t that
       hard. The ARRL exam manual I had even said not to try and
       understand questions, just “remeber the the answers”… and thats
       really all you have to do. But again, there are certainly guys that
       know their stuff.
       One of the best comments to an over zealos ham operator I ever
       heard was when I was preparing to a take a course on antennas
       offered by Georgia Tech and I myself had just started in the
       eletronics field. The ham operator assumed the professor was a ham
       as well, due the the fact “he plays with antennas all day”. The
       professor replied with a enthuastic “NO, If I were a dental
       hygienist, do you think I would want to clean peoples teeth as a
       hobby?” – Priceless…
       I now understand what the professor was saying. Electronics used to
       be my #1 passion as a hobby. It’s not as much fun to fire up that
       soldering iron at home or pour over schematics when you do it for a
       job all day. So hacking stuff for fun is one thing, doing it for a
       living may just turn your off to it when it’s other peoples
       projects you’re working on!

       socially awkward. I suspect that this is something that many

       ham radio.”
       I can relate to this for sure. My age at the time of writing is 18
       years old. I got my first license just a few days before my 16th
       birthday.
       I have had an interest in electronics since I was probably around 5
       years old, and it is generally easy to make friends in amateur
       radio.

       To the people that say that radio waves should be unregulated:
       That makes absolutely no sense! Many rules are in place to prevent
       chaos and make things run smoothly.
       Having anarchy on the radio waves would make them virtually
       unusable.
       I don’t agree with many of the restricted freedoms in this country,
       but that really has nothing to do with radio and is a topic for a
       difference discussion alltogether

       After recently taking my Technicians test at age 47 I truly believe
       if you can not pass that test you have no business owning a radio.
       It really isn’t that hard and as previous people have said take the
       practice tests enough you almost can memorize the answers. With all
       of the technology available to Hams now on so many avenues it is
       surely a fun time to have an operators license, it can really be a
       ticket to modding and hacking.

       I listen to much music and radio so I don’t have the ham radio on
       much, but when it starts getting ugly outside nothing beats the
       local repeater. Spotters are giving a (pun) blow by blow
       description of whats coming down and when it’s all clear. Nothing
       like narking on tornadoes.
       Even if you don’t get a license, find when and where hamfests
       occur. From Dayton to a local tailgate you will never fail to find
       tech that is useable what ever turns on your light.
