Conversations, not pages

   Why break conversations into awkward and arbitrary pages, where you
   have to constantly find the Next Page button?

   We've replaced all that with the power of just-in-time loading. Want to
   read more? Just keep scrolling down.

Get notifications when mentioned

   It's difficult to have a conversation when you can't hear anyone.

   When someone quotes your post, we'll notify you. When someone mentions
   your @name, we'll notify you. When someone replies to your post … well,
   you get the idea.

Simple, but with context

   Discourse is a simple, flat forum, where replies flow down the page in
   a line.

   Replies are attached to the bottom and top of each post, so you can
   optionally expand the context of the conversation – without breaking
   your flow.

Remembers your place

   Don't worry about reading an entire topic in one sitting – we'll always
   save your place for you.

   When you get back to it you'll start right where you left off.

Reply while you read

   Do you respond before you've read the whole topic, risking duplication
   and ridicule, or do you read to the end, possibly forgetting the post
   you specifically wanted to reply to?

   With Discourse you can respond and continue to read, altering your
   reply and adding new quotes from others as you delve into the topic!
   You can even jump around to other topics, quoting other posts. We'll
   save your spot – and your response – even if you finish on a different
   computer.

   screenshot

Reply as a linked topic

   You don't want to interrupt this scintillating conversation, but a post
   just triggered your memory about an upcoming event you think others
   should know about.

   No problem! Use "Reply as new topic" to keep everyone up to date
   without derailing the topic – and both topics will be visibly connected
   together.

Links automatically expand

   Want to share a cool link you found? Just paste it in on a single line
   and we'll do all the hard work to automatically make it awesome.

   Links to Wikipedia, YouTube, Amazon, GitHub, Twitter, Flickr and dozens
   of other popular web sites will automatically expand to provide
   additional context and information.

Real time updates

   If a topic changes while you are reading or responding to it, new
   replies will appear automatically without refreshing the page. And as
   new topics arrive, they appear at the top of the list.

   The conversation never leaves you behind!

Bring your friends

   Hate nagging your friends to sign up for Yet Another Site just to
   contribute their thoughts on a discussion?

   Once you're trusted, you can click a button to invite your friends via
   email and they can reply to your topic with a single click.

Paste to share images

   Want to share an image? Just copy and paste it in. Or drag and drop it
   in!

   Posting LOLCats has never been this easy.

Log in with … anything

   Tired of creating another user name and password on every web site? So
   are we.

   Use your existing Twitter, Facebook, Google, Yahoo, GitHub, or Persona
   credentials to log in. Or create a traditional username and password,
   too.

   screenshot

Moderation that scales with the community

   As users participate on Discourse by reading and posting, they gain
   trust.

   With that trust, they can help maintain the forum to prevent trolls,
   spammers, and bad actors from taking over.

   screenshot

Categories that grow with you

   The massive, obligatory list of subcategories that every new forum user
   is presented with when they visit the forum homepage is an obstacle.

   Categories are optional at Discourse; you can either opt to make
   categories mandatory and the category page the default homepage of your
   forum, or you can go with the simple, default list of topics and let
   categories naturally evolve as your forum grows.

   screenshot

Search that actually works

   Discourse offers a unified search on every page: just start typing and
   get results instantly as you type.

   Our search matches posts, categories, and users – and automatically
   prioritizes matches on the page you're on right now.

   screenshot

Simple metrics

   The goal of every link is to be clicked – so every link in Discourse
   shows a click count. Including links to other topics.

   We also track incoming links, so if a post you made becomes super
   popular, we'll tell you how on a line directly under the post.

   screenshot

Your stuff belongs to you

   We have built in robust import and export tools, both for the site
   owner and for individual users. Your content belongs to you; take it
   with you wherever you want to go.

   Our default discussion license is [11]Creative Commons, but you can
   choose to maximize rights for the site owner, or the users.

   screenshot

Comprehensive API

   Discourse has an excellent API. How do we know? Because our JavaScript
   application is built on top of it.

   Just about anything you can do in a web browser is accessible via REST.

   screenshot

No app required

   Discourse is designed from the beginning for high resolution touch
   devices.

   Move back and forth freely between your laptop and your tablet, without
   the constant irritation of being told this forum has an app, do you
   want it?
