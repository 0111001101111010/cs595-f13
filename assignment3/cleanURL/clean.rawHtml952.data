   Welcome!  We’re glad you landed at Oakland Schools’ Teaching Research
   Writing site.  This site supports middle and high school teachers
   across the disciplines engaged in teaching research writing.  So if
   you’re teaching students in grades 6-12 how to research and present
   their findings in an essay-based or multimedia format, you’ll find
   plentiful resources here.  The site addresses both informational and
   argument writing.

   Common Core State Standarsds emblem The Common Core State Standards‘
   focus on research spurred the creation of this site.  In our work with
   districts and teachers, [15]the project team recognized the need to
   provide a [16]student research independence continuum, [17]research
   writing skills progression, and [18]lessons to support teachers as they
   implement the new literacy standards.  The lessons on the site are
   intended to support existing research-related units you teach by
   focusing on particular skills in the research writing process.

   We hope you’ll stay awhile and return often!  The site will continue to
   evolve.

   Ideally, research writing is taught throughout the year via smaller
   tasks and projects, as the Common Core stipulates.  This approach
   allows for continued reinforcement of these all important skills.  By
   examining the skills progression and lessons on this site, you can make
   decisions about which skills you would like to focus on in the existing
   units and writing tasks you teach.

   We suggest perusing the site in the following order to move from the
   big picture to the more granular lesson level:
    1. [20]Student Research Independence Continuum - This framework
       outlines increasing degrees of student responsibility in the
       research writing process.
    2. [21]Research Writing Skills Progression - This interactive table
       charts skill development from grade 6 to 12; key skills in the
       progression are linked directly to ready to use lessons.
    3. [22]Lessons - These ready to use interactive lessons were created
       in Google Docs to allow for easy download and adaptation/revision
       by teachers.  They include handouts, Powerpoint presentations,
       suggested cloud-based tools, and visible thinking routines.
