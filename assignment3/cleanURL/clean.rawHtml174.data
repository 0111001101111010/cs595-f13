How BrowserSwarm works

    1. BrowserSwarm connects directly to your GitHub code repo.
    2. When your team makes updates, BrowserSwarm automatically runs your
       project's Unit Test Suite and supports Frameworks, like [8]QUnit,
       in the cloud using [9]SauceLabs browser automation.
    3. You can easily view or download the results.

   BrowserSwarm is designed to grow. Stay tuned as we add new Tests, Unit
   Testing Frameworks and automated testing across more browsers and
   devices.

The people behind BrowserSwarm

   BrowserSwarm is a project from appendTo, Sauce Labs and the Internet
   Explorer team:

   appendTo provides industry-leading front end software development and
   developer training services. Since 2009, appendTo has developed
   front-end solutions for companies including Lenovo, Microsoft, Pearson,
   Purdue Pharma, Pitney Bowes and Time, Inc. In addition to delivering
   some of the most sophisticated front-end solutions on the market, our
   corporate clients and independent developers worldwide rely on appendTo
   for solution delivery and training.

   The Internet Explorer team collaborated on BrowserSwarm to help make it
   easier for you to test your JavaScript framework across modern browsers
   like Chrome, Firefox, and IE9+. We also included support for older
   versions of IE to help test your site in all versions of IE. If you
   need more help testing you can also download free virtual machines for
   your Mac, Linux, or Windows box at [10]http://modern.IE.

   BrowserSwarm is powered by Sauce Labs, a cloud-based testing platform
   that allows developers and QA engineers to automatically test mobile
   and web apps across 150+ browser / OS combinations, including iOS,
   Android & Mac OS X. Whether running automated Selenium tests and
   Javascript unit tests, Sauce lets you easily scale test coverage
   without ever setting up or maintaining test infrastructure. Sauce works
   locally or behind the firewall with a secure tunnel, and supports
   multiple programming languages and testing frameworks. Sauce is also
   [11]free for open source projects and integrates with other popular CI
   systems like Travis, Strider, Jenkins and Bamboo.
