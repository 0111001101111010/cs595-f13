[2]Rails Named Routes: Path Vs. URL

   [3]Extend // Feb 20, 2009 [4]Comments

   As we all learned in Rails 101, named routes come in two varieties:
   path, and URL. When should we use each variety?

   Let's say we have this entry in a routes.rb file:
map.resources :doohickeys

   So, we can refer to doohickeys_path, which returns a relative URI:
link_to 'index of doohickeys', doohickeys_path # => <a href="/doohickeys">index
of doohickeys</a>

   And we can refer to doohickeys_url, which returns an absolute URI:
link_to 'index of doohickeys', doohickeys_url  # => <a href="http://www.example.
com/doohickeys">index of doohickeys</a>

   So when do you use paths, and when do you use URLs? I had heard that
   there are two cases when you must use URLs:
    1. You need to use an absolute URI when linking to an SSL site from a
       non-SSL site, and vice versa.
    2. You need to use an absolute URI when creating a redirect (e.g. with
       redirect_to.)

   In talking with some fellow developers here at Viget, and at
   [5]Thoughtbot when I trained there recently, we agreed that the Rails
   convention seems to be to use URLs in these two cases, and paths in
   other cases. But why?

   The first case is pretty obvious; you need the absolute URI in order to
   get the https:// prefix for a secure site (and likewise to get the
   http:// prefix if you need to get back to where you were.) For the
   second case, you need to dig into the [6]HTTP specification, also known
   as RFC 2616. In particular, you need to find section 14.30, which
   defines the Location header that’s returned in a redirect. Here’s the
   chapter and verse:

     The Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient
     to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the
     request or identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created)
     responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was
     created by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD
     indicate the server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the
     resource. The field value consists of a single absolute URI.

   (Emphasis added.) So that’s the answer: we do it this way because the
   specification says we have to. Since we’re all about conventions in the
   Rails community, we may as well have our convention follow the spec. Is
   it critical to do so? Probably not; most modern HTTP clients and
   servers seem to figure out what you meant if you pass a relative URL in
   a redirect. But why take the chance when it’s easy to do the right
   thing?
