How A Rookie Photographer Stumbled Across This
SHOCKING Photography Secret:

   "DISCOVER HOW TO TURN YOUR
   PHOTOGRAPHY SNAPSHOTS TO TOP CLASS
   PHOTOS WITHOUT WASTING MONEY ON
   EXPENSIVE ACCESSORIES AND MONTHS
   OF PRACTICE...ALMOST INSTANTLY!"

   From: Gerald Soh

   Dear Friend,
   If you love photography just as I do and want to take beautiful
   pictures, then this is going to be the most exciting message you will
   ever read.
   Imagine...being able to take beautiful photos at the next family outing
   & impressing everyone with your flash photography skills...wouldn’t it
   be great to finally be the talk of the party?
   Gerald Soh

   My name is Gerald Soh and yes, I do look like a Taiwan Superstar =]

   Now, I didn’t start out as a professional photographer with many
   expensive camera lenses, flash guns and other equipments.
   I had problems while taking photos in wedding dinners, in
   parties....during vacations....and I just couldn’t take nice photos.
   Most of the photos taken were either blurry, overexposed, too much
   contrast and others.

   I was a struggling so-called photographer trying to learn how shoot
   like an experienced photographer.
   Obviously, I failed many times.
   I couldn’t even take a simple beautiful picture because I wasn’t gifted
   in photography.

   I spent my hard-earned money from my part time job to attend
   photography courses, but didn’t learn what I needed to achieve the
   realism of an experienced photographer.

   I can still remember the first time I offered to take photos for my
   relative’s baby back in 2007, when I didn’t really understand how to
   attain my potential.

   I thought I managed to take nice photos, so I shared it with all my
   friends – but they laughed at my photography skills.
   Because I’m Not Gifted In Photography, Most Of My Friends Told Me To
   Give Up!

   Looking at their photos, I felt that I was not as skilful, couldn’t
   take photos as well as they could. I Might As Well Stayed At Home And
   Watched Football.

   And after awhile, I tend to shy away from family outings and my buddies
   stopped inviting me to go hang out with them.

   Until today, I still keep that few baby photos that I shot in my mini
   photography lab...
   First Baby Picture

   After years of trials and errors, I’m now able to take a baby’s photo
   like this...
   First Baby Picture

   This is not from overnight success. I’ve been practicing and learning
   for almost every single day to attain a higher level of photography
   skills.

   The truth is... there was this one year period that I did not improve
   my photography techniques at all. After achieving the results that I
   wanted, I concentrated on teaching others (my cousins and friends), at
   the expense of myself. Because of teaching others, I lack of practice
   time and stopped learning in photography for almost a year! My
   photography techniques became stuck at the same level without
   improvement.

   Deep down in my heart, I know that I’ve been satisfied for where I am
   in my photography techniques and skills. I’ve been satisfied that I
   stopped improving my photography skills.
   Then, one day, everything changed...

   I was invited to join an event that is organized for every photographer
   to share their masterpiece with everyone.

   I suddenly did not feel so satisfied anymore. I had thought I was good
   enough to master the art of photography... until I met many experienced
   photographers who were far better than me.

   Suddenly, I felt like an amateur photographer who just owned a camera
   yesterday!

   And while I was inspired by them, being with these experienced
   photographers made me totally dissatisfied.

   It was time to do some soul searching...

   You see, most people take expensive photography courses and buy many
   different types of pricey equipments.

   The problem is...

   I don't have thousands of dollars to throw at new cameras, lights, and
   to enrol in courses as I have spent most of my hard-earned money.
   So, I decided to learn the hard way.

   I sat at my “little photography lab” at home looking at all of my
   previous photos taken… and eventually thought of a different way to
   shoot them. A different way to make photos look more interesting and
   beautiful.

   I begin practicing and taking photos every day again to crack the code
   of going to the next level of photography…

   The word "practice makes perfect" is so true!

   After months of practicing...
   I Discovered Something.....

   I notice a similar pattern among most photographers. Most of them, if
   not all of them mentioned this same concern. They hold an “unfair
   advantage” of upper card because they knew about this long time ago.
   They knew the importance of this and through hard times and lots of
   effort; they perfect this specific skill which makes them a
   professional in this field.
   This is definitely the
   X-Factor of Photography!
   First Baby Picture
   I know you’re thinking...what are the benefits of knowing the X-FACTOR
   and being able to take beautiful photos?
   Checkmark Use the X-FACTOR of photography to capture emotions instead
   of just plain moments
   …and combine the science and art for spectacular results.
   Checkmark Never missing another "priceless moment" while figuring out
   the right camera setting
   – you will have the amazing ability to capture a moment, an essence of
   someone so beautifully and brings joy to those who see it.
   Checkmark Being praised by others for your photography skills – your
   friends will be bugging you every day, asking you to teach them how to
   shoot like you!
   Checkmark Shoot a picture that really is worth a thousand words! –well,
   not many photographers can do so.
   Checkmark Save lots of time without having to edit your photos using
   software – originality is the keyword. If you notice, experienced
   photographers seldom edit their photos.
   Checkmark Sell your “masterpiece” for extra income – you can turn your
   hobby into a money making business!
   Checkmark You can earn more by becoming a freelance photographer – and
   maybe quit your daily 9-5 job!
   Checkmark Capture special events like a special birthday or the family
   vacation with clear, well composed pictures – be the chosen one to
   capture great photos and share them with everyone.
   Checkmark Have a self-fulfilling shot or even better, a great career in
   photography – it’s worth it even though you are all worn out
   Checkmark Most importantly, take beautiful photographs that you and
   your loved ones proudly frame and display – priceless!
   Checkmark And much more!

   When I found out about the X-FACTOR, I began to understand how
   everything works and applied what I have learnt over the past few
   years.
   All these hard work truly changed my photography life.

   Now, I am proud to say that I am able to capture AWESOME and PRICELESS
   photos like the one below.

   And guess what?

   I’m always busy taking beautiful photos of my family outing and friends
   are always calling me out for photo shooting sessions. I even have
   friends who asked me to be their wedding photographer for their
   important day!

   How cool is that?

   You know...it feels GREAT when people praise and compliment on your
   professional photo shooting skills. It feels like you are on top of the
   world! I know you would want to feel like this too. And I want to share
   you with more about this X-FACTOR.

   Below are some of the examples of great photos taken by me and my
   fellow photographer friends. It may not be the most beautiful photos in
   the world but at least I am proud to say that I can take better quality
   photos now. And I hope you can too in the future.
