   Vancouver Island river
   Video screen capture Central Westcoast Forest Society

   The Atleo river runs through Clayoquot Sound on Vancouver Island,
   traditional territory of the Ahousaht First Nation. The river is home
   to seven kinds of salmon and other species of fish, and is an important
   resource for the Ahousaht people.

   However, the river's fish population and the surrounding habitat have
   been threatened, particularly by settlement and landslide problems.
   Many of these problems were caused by historical logging practices.
   Today, the Central Westcoast Forest Society is undertaking a
   restoration effort. [19]They write on their site:

     "Unfortunately, many streams and watersheds have been significantly
     damaged or altered by human impacts on the landscape. The culture
     and ecosystems that depend on wild salmon are threatened by their
     loss. To be successful, recovery efforts require a holistic
     watershed-level approach."

   The video below shows this process unfolding. It was created by Drew
   Burke and Mark Wyatt for the Central Westcoast Forest Society.
