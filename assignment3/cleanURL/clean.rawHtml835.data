5 Reasons College Students Should Be in Professional Organizations

   What's This?
   Professional-organizations
   By James Mignano2013-06-24 03:00:33 UTC

   âStudent engagement is the product of motivation and active learning.
   It is a product rather than a sum because it will not occur if either
   element is missing,â writes Elizabeth F. Barkley in [47]Student
   Engagement Techniques: A Handbook for College Faculty. I'm a college
   student myself, and I'm very familiar with this equation â and [48]how
   low the product sometimes can be.

   Take professional associations, for example. They exist in essentially
   every industry, and most offer substantially discounted student rates.
   Yet in my experience, not many college students are motivated enough to
   get involved. Should they?

   Here are five reasons why students should be active in associations
   that align with their career path.

1. Test the Water

   Itâs perfectly normal and acceptable for students to change their
   majors in college at least once or twice. But it is also in the best
   interest of your bank account to change your mind earlier rather than
   later. Itâs going to be pretty tough to graduate in four or even five
   years if you decide to transition from Recreation and Leisure to
   Chemistry halfway through your junior year.

   If you had attended a few meetings or events hosted by the National
   Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) during your freshman year, you
   probably would realize much sooner that this wasnât the right field for
   you. If you arenât positive about how in love you are with your major,
   what better way to figure it out, than to get outside of the campus
   bubble and see how it really looks in the real world?

2. Add to Your Education

   Through award ceremonies, roundtable discussions or guest speaker
   presentations, professional organizations provide plenty of ways to
   simply learn about an industry. Why do you think so many established,
   successful individuals participate in them? It keeps them sharp and
   refreshed on current trends, new ideas and different approaches.

   Even in less formal networking opportunities, there are many things to
   learn from talking with the best of the best in any industry. Listen
   carefully to the language they use to discuss their work, and the types
   of things that seem important to them. Chances are, information like
   this will be more valuable than the things you read in your textbook
   the day before your midterm exam.

3. Experience the City

   If you went away to college in an area youâve never lived before, itâs
   important to leave campus and get a feel for the rest of the area, as
   well. No matter how great your campusâ amenities are, you will graduate
   one day, and wonât be able to hang out by the pool tables in your
   residence hall anymore.

   Even if you chose to go to college very close to where you grew up,
   like I did, you'll still manage to see and experience different things
   than you would have if you didnât attend events of local organizations.
   From new restaurants and bars to auditoriums of other nearby colleges,
   itâs all a part of learning the culture of the area in which you find
   yourself.

4. Build a Portfolio

   If youâre confident in the career path youâve chosen, and checked out a
   few meetings of an organization already, it might be time to look for
   even bigger benefits. Professional associations are made up of
   volunteers -â most of whom have day-jobs, families and social lives
   that matter, as well. In other words, the leadership is likely to be
   open to having some extra help.

   There are a ton of things you can do to get involved with an
   association, and simultaneously grow your experience and portfolio. For
   example, offer to live-tweet the next event, write a blog post to
   promote it or distribute survey questions after the event to improve
   event attendance.

5. Network

   Most importantly, professional associations are composed of your future
   boss, hiring manager and colleagues. In the ultra-competitive job
   market that young professionals face today, itâs no secret that the
   adage, âItâs not what you know, itâs who you knowâ rings true.

   In this day and age, we have the advantage of digital and social tools
   to enhance and simplify our networking efforts. During each event, itâs
   important that you meet at least three to five new contacts.
   Afterwards, connect with them on LinkedIn, [49]including a personal
   note so they remember who you are. Follow them on Twitter, and donât be
   afraid to talk to them about a professional topic. Not only will you
   stay on their radar, you will also be building your relationships,
   which could prove to be invaluable in your job search.

   If youâre a student, do you participate in professional organizations
   yet? If youâre already a pro, what advice do you give students
   interested in your career field? Let us know in the comments.
