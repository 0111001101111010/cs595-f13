<p> From: Gerald Soh </p>
<p> Dear Friend,<br>
If you love photography just as I do and want to take beautiful
pictures, then this is going to be the most exciting message you will
ever read.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="thoughtBoxTan">
Imagine...being able to take beautiful photos at the next family outing
&amp; impressing everyone with your flash photography
skills...wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to finally be the talk of the
party? </div>
<div id="mainContent"> <img src="images/gs.jpg" id="gs"
 alt="Gerald Soh">
<p> My name is Gerald Soh and yes,
I do look like a Taiwan Superstar =]<br>
</p>
<p> Now, I didn&rsquo;t start
out as a professional photographer with many expensive camera lenses,
flash guns and other equipments. </p>
I had problems while taking photos in wedding dinners, in
parties....during vacations....and I just couldn&rsquo;t take nice
photos. Most of the photos taken were either blurry, overexposed, too
much contrast and others.
<p> I was a struggling so-called
photographer trying to learn how shoot like an experienced photographer.<br>
Obviously, I failed many times. </p>
<div class="new"> <span class="yellowBackground">I couldn&rsquo;t even
take a simple beautiful picture because I wasn&rsquo;t gifted in
photography.</span> </div>
<p> I spent my hard-earned money
from my part time job to attend photography courses, but
didn&rsquo;t learn what I needed to achieve the realism of an
experienced photographer. </p>
<p> I can still remember the first
time I offered to take photos for my relative&rsquo;s baby back in
2007, when I didn&rsquo;t really understand how to attain my
potential. </p>
<p> I thought I managed to take
nice photos, so I shared it with all my friends &ndash; but they
laughed at my photography skills. </p>
<div class="largeYellow"> <span class="yellowBackgroundLarge">Because
I&rsquo;m
Not Gifted In Photography, Most Of My Friends Told Me To Give Up!</span>
</div>
<p> Looking at their photos, I
felt that I was not as skilful, couldn&rsquo;t take photos as well
as they could. I Might As Well Stayed At Home And Watched Football. </p>
<p> And after awhile, I tend to
shy away from family outings and my buddies stopped inviting me to go
hang out with them. </p>
<p> <strong>Until
today, I still keep that few baby photos that I shot in my mini
photography lab...</strong> </p>
<div class="centerImage"> <img src="images/childnew.png"
 alt="First Baby Picture">
</div>
<p> After years of trials and
errors, I&rsquo;m now able to take a baby&rsquo;s photo like
this... </p>
<div class="centerImage"> <img src="images/baby.jpg" id="baby"
 alt="First Baby Picture">
</div>
<p> This is not from overnight
success. I&rsquo;ve been practicing and learning for almost every
single day to attain a higher level of photography skills. </p>
<p> The truth is... there was this
one year period that I did not improve my photography techniques at
all. After achieving the results that I wanted, I concentrated on
teaching others (my cousins and friends), at the expense of myself.
Because of teaching others, I lack of practice time and stopped
learning in photography for almost a year! My photography techniques
became stuck at the same level without improvement. </p>
<p> Deep down in my heart, I know
that I&rsquo;ve been satisfied for where I am in my photography
techniques and skills. I&rsquo;ve been satisfied that I stopped
improving my photography skills. </p>
<div class="yellowBackground">
<span class="largeText1">Then,
one day, everything changed...</span>
</div>
<p> I was invited to join an event
that is organized for every photographer to share their masterpiece
with everyone. </p>
<p> I suddenly did not feel so
satisfied anymore. I had thought I was good enough to master the art of
photography... until I met many experienced photographers who were far
better than me. </p>
<p> <strong>Suddenly,
I felt like an amateur photographer who just owned a camera yesterday!</strong>
</p>
<p> And while I was inspired by
them, being with these experienced photographers made me totally
dissatisfied. </p>
<p> It was time to do some soul
searching... </p>
<p> You see, most people take
expensive photography courses and buy many different types of pricey
equipments. </p>
<p> <span class="largeTextPlain">The problem is...</span>
</p>
<p> I don't have thousands of
dollars to throw at new cameras, lights, and to enrol in courses as I
have spent most of my hard-earned money. </p>
<div class="center"> <span class="yellowBackground2">So, I decided to
learn the
hard way.</span> </div>
<p> I sat at my &ldquo;little
photography lab&rdquo; at home looking at all of my previous photos
taken&hellip; and eventually thought of a different way to shoot
them. A different way to make photos look more interesting and
beautiful. </p>
<p> I begin practicing and taking
photos every day again to crack the code of going to the next level of
photography&hellip; </p>
<p> <strong>The
word "practice makes perfect" is so true!</strong>
</p>
<p> After months of practicing...<br>
</p>
<br>
<div class="largeRedText">
I Discovered Something..... </div>
<br>
<p> I notice a similar pattern
among most photographers. Most of them, if not all of them mentioned
this same concern. They hold an &ldquo;unfair advantage&rdquo;
of upper card because they knew about this long time ago. They knew the
importance of this and through hard times and lots of effort; they
perfect this specific skill which makes them a professional in this
field. </p>
