Assignment #11
Due: 11:59pm Dec 12 2013

NOTE: Assignment #11 is for extra credit only; you do not
have to do this assignment if you do not want to.
Each question is worth up to 5 points (for a total of 
10 possible points).

Support your answer: include all relevant discussion, assumptions,
examples, etc.

1.  Using the data from A9:

- Consider each row in the blog-term matrix as a 500 dimension vector, 
corresponding to a blog.  

- From chapter 8, replace numpredict.euclidean() with cosine as the 
distance metric.  In other words, you'll be computing the cosine between
vectors of 500 dimensions.  

- Use knnestimate() to compute the nearest neighbors for both:

for k={1,2,5,10,20}.

2.  Rerun A10, Q2 but this time using LIBSVM.  If you have n categories,
you'll have to run it n times.  For example, if you're classifying music
and have the categories:

metal, electronic, ambient, folk, hip-hop, pop

you'll have to classify things as:

metal / not-metal
electronic / not-electronic
ambient / not-ambient

etc.

Use the 500 term vectors describing each blog as the features, and
your mannally assigned classifications as the true values.  Use
10-fold cross-validation (as per slide 46, which shows 4-fold
cross-validation) and report the percentage correct for 
each of your categories.
